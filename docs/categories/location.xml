(There's also talk of very high-quality drugs being much freely available than elsewhere in the city state.)&lt;br&gt;On the other hand there's a waiting list, and would-be home-owners are vetted for adherence to the governing party line, everyone is encouraged to spy on and report on their neighbours, people get arrested and frogmarched off the street and from cafés in broad daylight, inhabitants are ready to spray political insults on the cars and houses of those deemed disloyal in an attempt to look patriotic. They literally police themselves, usually overzealously.&lt;br&gt;So much so that it is an open secret that law enforcement is pretty much left to local neighbourhood watch groups, there's much less surveillance around, and locals typically pride themselves on the fact that they 'behave even when the masters aren't looking'. Ironically, this laissez-faire attitude is drawing dissenters to these areas (to conspire, subvert, or to be able to eat some of the best ice cream in town, and relax without being on camera), which, in turn, puts the local paramilitaries on high alert.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lakótelep internet&lt;/h2&gt;Housing estates in Mage: The Budapest Urbancrawl have the highest-speed internet in the land; the donwside is that it's only available in dedicated public spaces, never in people's homes (there might even be shielding or scrambling installed in places to prevent people from accessing the net in private), and that there are whole swaths of the web that can't be reached. Rumours of comment factories and paid internet troll armies operating out of one or more &lt;i&gt;lakótelep&lt;/i&gt;s abound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt; 13 lakótelep [lɒkoːtɛlɛp] encounters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td class="numbercell"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt;Pop-up open-air market.

Perhaps it was the building technology, quite unique in the district (the building is actually not a prefab at all)? Perhaps it was that the high-rise was meant to be the iconic symbol of the district, and the intention was a success beyond the city planners' wildest dreams? However it happened, the building's spirit woke up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Personality &lt;/h2&gt;It has, from Day 1, considered itself a sort of guardian or mother figure&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;to its 'little siblings', that is, the bunches of 10-story prefabs that stream out from its hub like the spokes of a wheel,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to the tiny little people with the exotic little consciousness-blobs hanging around them,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to the trees, playgrounds, statues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;After all, it had been its duty to supply nurturing, cleaning, refreshing, sustaining drinking water to most of them. (The building was a functioning water tower for only ten years after being erected.)&lt;br&gt;In exchange for favours, the tower spirit always asks for some quest to be undertaken to help the district in a specific or general way - clean up park, replace lock, make crossing in front of kindergarten safe, find key/pet parrot/lost cat and return it to owner, prevent suicide, prevent local branch of library from getting cut from next year's budget, etc.&lt;br&gt;However, to this day the water pipes act as a surveillance network of sorts through which the Water Tower High-Rise has psychic access to a surprisingly large proportion of the district's built environment - the specifics of this link is left to Storyteller discretion.&lt;br&gt;What is certain, however, is that to make use of the effect, a mage needs to enter the former cisterns at the very top of the tower, either physically, or in the Penumbra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gate-keeper&lt;/h2&gt;The erstwhile cisterns have been remodelled into two large studio flats, inside one of which lives, rent-free, Harsányi (&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;ˈhɒrʃaːɲ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;]), the council-sponsored caretaker of the high-rise.

It was inevitable that a semi-official market-place should spring up for people looking for magickal knick-knacks. In fact, this market-place was bound to be somewhere on &lt;a href="https://www.budapestbylocals.com/margaret-island.html"&gt;Margaret Island&lt;/a&gt; (Margit-sziget [&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;ˈmɒrɡit,&lt;/span&gt;siɡɛt&lt;/span&gt;]), smack in the middle of the stretch of Danube dividing the city into Buda and Pest, with magickal waters flowing around it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="600" src="https://www.legifoto.com/files/margitsziget.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The island itself, on account of the ever-replenishing Quintessence that the Danube around it carries 24-7, is an oasis for not just mages - people are unconsciously drawn to the place and enjoy the natural high that comes with magic literally being in the air.&lt;br&gt;There are joggers, families with children, and anyone aching for the outdoors; there's a swimming pool, a petting zoo, and no internal combustion engines are allowed in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The market&lt;/h2&gt;The 'market' itself is as unassuming as can be - two floating pier sheds full of kayaks, boats, oars, and other boating and kayaking gear on the left-hand side of the photo above (facing the Buda side). They belong to the Budapest Boating Association with a HQ on the opposite side of the island, and only a handful of people know about the sheds' more mystical purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="600" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EOD25jnvIlw/XK9Dt9lqLmI/AAAAAAAA1iY/TTLUyTEfGSYLkOh3w6WXvM7ZtJx-DPvwgCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20190411_153612_534.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;View of the kayak and boating paraphernalia sheds that double as the market-place from the Pest quay&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you know the right passphrase, look familiar to the two 'shopkeepers', or seem like you need an item to help you out (or deserve an item that brings you misery), you will find that the sheds in fact are crammed full of the most interesting magickal stuff, large and small.&lt;br&gt;Customers are normally charged a small quest in exchange for items.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gulyás and Hóbor, the shopkeepers&lt;/h2&gt;They're really a two-man Euthanatos cabal who have taken it upon themselves to better the world by controlling the distribution of harmful and beneficial magic items.&lt;br&gt;Gulyás (&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;[ˈɡujaːʃ]) is the younger one of the pair, in his twenties, handsome, quiet, brooding, and in fact very manipulative, especially of Hóbor (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;[ˈhoːbor]&lt;/span&gt;), the nominal leader of their little cult. In fact, he's the 'power behind the throne' - Hóbor rarely admits it to himself, but he's head over heels in love with his young ward, and will do anything to keep him by his side. Gulyás is part of the gardening crew on the island, and has a uniform and a pass that gets him access to virtually anywhere on Margit-sziget. The quests he likes to set for people who come looking for talismans and wonders slowly but surely build a web of contacts and information with him sitting in the middle, a fat spider pulling the strings, a but like Leland Gaunt in Needful Things. At least that's the way he likes to think of what he does.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;Hóbor on the other hand comes as close to a wise old hippy stereotype as a Euthanatos can. likes sharing his unique mystical worldview with anyone who will listen, rambling on while fishing on the pier. He can't hold down a decent job on account of his missing left arm, but the boating association keeps him on as watchmen/groundsman. He keeps bees - all the bees on the island come from one of his hives, tucked in nooks and crannies - and he likes to command them into clouds and direct them around like some Biblical prophet. He can take over the swarm's senses and so finds out about a surprising many things even though he never leaves the island.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;Sample items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;Pair of scissors. When used to cut off all of someone's hair will make collected hair have limited divining powers. Think &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SVjE2cg3Tc"&gt;Queequeg in the 1956 version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;Some loose leaf tea that when brewed in a special pot with water taken from one of the Buda Hill caverns as part of a secret ritual, will grant the drinker the power to answer any yes-no question correctly within a 24-hour time frame.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;A pearl that will make an urn fill up with whatever is already inside when left in it unattended overnight. Causes havoc if urn is opened while magic is going on (along the lines of overabundance (Think jelly flood in Ben and Holly), or a Geas related to the thing that is being multiplied (such as the witness gets allergic to that thing from then on, or must eat/create that thing every day, or cannot say its name).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4334"&gt;Betz Sphere&lt;/a&gt;: seems to have limited consciousness, moves around on its own accord, self-preserving, attuned to specific frequencies, highly magnetic, resists scrying attempts.

Drone of air circulation fans audible throughout the tunnel, louder in places.&lt;br&gt;Faint aroma of floor polish mixed with the catch of the day - takeaway coffee spilled by low-level ministry officials in a hurry, milk, fish, or vegetables dropping off carriages on their way to the Batthyány Square market hall, some decomposing pigeon pulled apart by crows in the relative safety of the tunnel.&lt;br&gt;Beggars, musician buskers (if there's more than 2, there is no way you can make out any melody as the tunnel acoustics mess up the sound), and usually quite a few security patrols.&lt;br&gt;CCTV.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What you can use it for&lt;/h2&gt;The tunnel is great for foot chases - especially when its under construction, and one or both lanes are barricaded off.&lt;br&gt;Given the thick divider walls, there must be quite a few niches where CCTV doesn't pick you up, should a mage require a secluded spot for the exchange of illicit goods and/or information.&lt;br&gt;There's always a chance of an accident, or better yet, a terrorist act that happens to include some of the PCs walking in the tunnel.&lt;br&gt;Hostage situation.&lt;br&gt;A mage terrorist cell (they exist!) attempting to infiltrate the Szabadság tér Szövetkezet (&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;[ˈsøvɛtkɛzɛt])&lt;/span&gt; headquarters from within the cover of the tunnel.&lt;br&gt;The whole site is kind of spooky, and I imagine both the Gauntlet and the Consensus are a bit flakier than usual down there - just remember that you're 15 metres underground, below a whole lot of water.&lt;br&gt;(Image credit &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@dominikmartin"&gt;Dominik Martin at Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)</description><category>location</category><guid>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/04/the-polanyi-tunnel-footbridge/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2019 15:55:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Rudas Thermal Baths - Location, NPC, Plot Hooks</title><link>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/03/the-rudas-thermal-baths-location-npc/</link><dc:creator>Bujna Balázs</dc:creator><description>&lt;a href="http://en.rudasfurdo.hu/"&gt;Rudas Baths (pronounced something like "Roux Dosh" ([ˈrudɒʃ]))&lt;/a&gt; is one of the Turkish-style bath houses in Budapest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://i1.wp.com/welovebudapest.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/Rudas-Fu%CC%88rdo%CC%8B_Bo%CC%81dis-Krisztia%CC%81n_006.jpg?resize=1200%2C720&amp;amp;ssl=1" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="480" data-original-width="800" height="192" src="https://i1.wp.com/welovebudapest.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/Rudas-Fu%CC%88rdo%CC%8B_Bo%CC%81dis-Krisztia%CC%81n_006.jpg?resize=1200%2C720&amp;amp;ssl=1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the M:TBU setting, it is a location much like &lt;a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Digital_Web_(book)"&gt;the Spy's Demise BBS detailed in Digital Web&lt;/a&gt;: perhaps the only place in town where the Awakened and Enlightened of any stripe can come together and talk without fear of aggression. By mutual agreement, Technocrats and Traditionalist, hell, even upstart Disparates, can rub shoulders here and chat.&lt;br&gt;How is that possible?&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Location&lt;/h1&gt; The waters of  the Rudas Thermal Bath are heavily &lt;a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_(MTAs)"&gt;Prime-infused&lt;/a&gt; and serves as the basis of an implicit truce - no need to fight when there's plenty of the good stuff for everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Baths are ideal for making plans, diplomatic encounters, trying to ferret out the enemies plans, subtle backstabbing, building up or losing face, or just to lay back &amp;amp; soak up Quintessence in wondrous environment.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;I like to play up the intoxicating nature of this  naturally-occurring Quintessence so that getting wet is like having a  few beers. You get giddy if you save your saving throw.&lt;/h4&gt;(Mechanically, I give everyone who stays at least an hour in the water d10/2 temporary Quintessence - they only find out how much when they leave, and it's lost if not used up within 24 hours. That's not a tamper proof rule, but what is?)&lt;br&gt;The explanation is that there's a Horizon node with a portal somewhere inside &lt;a href="https://welovebudapest.com/en/venue/gellert-hill-2/"&gt;Gellért Hill&lt;/a&gt;, where the magickal water springs from. Its location is a secret guarded from everyone, including their Traditionalist peers, by &lt;span class="tooltip" title="To be covered in a future post."&gt;the Monkey King Collective,&lt;/span&gt; a small cabal of semi-rogue Budapest mages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;If the spring fell into the wrong hands, the fallout would be devastating.&lt;/h4&gt;Though the Technocracy pays lip-service to the agreement that everyone has equal rights to the magick water, they still keep trying to covertly find the Rudas Node - and some would say every single other faction is after the Node too. &lt;a href="https://www.xpatloop.com/channels/2018/09/gellert-hill-funicular-under-construction.html"&gt;There is a funicular secretly being built that would carve into the side of the hill&lt;/a&gt; - it's an open secret that this is a smokescreen to cover the search for the Node, but no-one is sure who is behind the project.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h1&gt;NPC&lt;/h1&gt;Everyone who's been to the place more than twice knows Béla (&lt;span class="st"&gt;[ˈbeːlɒ]) (and he will definitely know regulars by name), the affable if moody locker room attendant who some think might be &lt;a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Extraordinary_Citizen"&gt;an Extraordinary Citizen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product_info.php?products_id=19&amp;amp;it=1&amp;amp;language=es&amp;amp;"&gt;a consor&lt;/a&gt;. The amount of magickal activity he must have been exposed to in his decades on the job could have affected him, but others think he's actually 'repelling magick and/or Paradox', arguing that he couldn't have survived. Anyways, he's a talking point among bath patrons - an ice-breaker when at a loss for what to say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="st"&gt;He's got a no-nonsense attitude and never gets fazed by anything - he sure acts like he's seen it all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="480" data-original-width="800" height="192" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/19/16/10005514-6720971-image-a-7_1550595563042.jpg"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Béla, locker room attendant&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;He could be a fixer, a concierge, a messenger, a procurer of under-the-counter goods and/or a fountainhead of gossip for your PCs.&lt;br&gt;In my game he's a decidedly non-magickal ex-con who's got the cushy job in exchange for regular reports to &lt;a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-technocracy-magical-premise.html"&gt;the people in the Szabadság Square bunkers&lt;/a&gt;. His job description includes turning a blind eye to the shenanigans of mages high on Quintessence, and taking notes, but he likes bribes, and anyone who helps his daughter (a stunning and bubbly ballerina who tends to get mixed up in trouble) has a place in his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Plot Hook&lt;/h1&gt;These are variations on "protect the water", but there's always the Nephandus plot that subtly taints the water to cause strife and overdoses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magick is no protection against encroaching bureaucracy - council plans to shut down the place temporarily or to modify its water source (!) must be stopped by hook or by crook. Legal, illegal, or magickal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The bath-house is being renovated, and builders find a Wonder or a portal (could it be the sought-after link to the Node?). Technocrats and Mages need to band together to overcome the inevitable pointing of fingers and point-scoring to hush up the discovery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The water starts to ebb. What's up? Foul play in Budapest, or some trouble over at the Horizon end?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><category>location</category><category>NPC</category><category>plot-hook</category><guid>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/03/the-rudas-thermal-baths-location-npc/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2019 21:48:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
