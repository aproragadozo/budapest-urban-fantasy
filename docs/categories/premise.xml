Soon, quasi-official paramilitary group indirectly enjoying the support of the government via a high-prestige government-funded non-for-profit organization show up, effectively demanding protection money in the form of some obscure tax. The tax is legit, turns out every single business is already paying, no two ways about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;McGuffin: a list of high-ranking officials that a large construction firm has bribed. The government wants it, and might be willing to let the company operate in Budapest in exchange for the list and a hefty fine. Some radical mage group/non-mage group aided by mages wants to expose the list; they fear the government is going to make the list disappear once they get a hold of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PCs witness a clandestine meeting between high-ranking mage (NPC from PCs' own org) and a &lt;a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-technocracy-magical-premise.html"&gt;Szövetkezet&lt;/a&gt; manager (on moving trams, hopping from one line to the next, mingling with crowds; accidentally spotted, quite difficult to follow, but actually conspicuous once PCs know what to look for). When PCs reveal their findings (to either party, or the media), one or both parties try bribing them, NPC claims acting "for the greater good".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;False-flag operation: politician taken hostage, or mayor/priest/celebrity assassinated, or high-rise/public transport river boat station/tram/concourse in mall is blown up. PCs are either the perpetrators, acting on a request of higher-ups in their orgs, or involved as witnesses/investigators. The interesting bit is that clues are planted or asked to be planted that incriminate a specific other organization. Reprisals. Escalation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smuggling people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PCs are political prisoners under house arrest, and they're the ones being smuggled out of their homes, quite unexpectedly and unbidden, by some shadowy org they have never heard of before. What's the agenda?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are strict border controls and immigration policies in place  (basically there is a maximum number of immigrants the city will take in  a year). PCs are involved in smuggling people into Budapest for profit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PC smuggling ring is run on bribery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PC smuggling ring is run in the Umbra - how do you cheat Paradox/Szövetkezet hackers on your trail?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smuggling ring routinely involves shootouts with police, and explosions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PCs must whisk some out-of-town magical messenger across the city-wide blockade set up by protesters (The introduction of a new tax has been tabled in parliament, one that hits cyclists/smokers/drug-users/construction workers/health service staff/families of five or less people/etc. hard, and spontaneous resistance has sprung up. Budapest in deadlock for days now - no-one is allowed to cross the bridges and checkpoints except for ambulances and fire brigades.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People are being made magically sick (via public transport system/fireworks/as part of a sham or real population census). The illness is a form of colour blindness where people have a hard time differentiating between various bank notes. This is doubly interesting for mages, given how frequent this particular affliction pops up as a Paradox flaw - now regular non-magical folks are getting it too. Heavily marketed new and expensive medication promises to cure the special form of colour blindness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Appeasing the Budapest spirits. A series of accidents and sabotage at major construction site in city. Some &lt;span&gt;fin de siècle celebrity's (surely &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:20th-century_Hungarian_poets"&gt;a poet&lt;/a&gt; or an impresario) spirit or a building spirit (some crumbling or well-maintained &lt;a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/why-budapest-is-famous-for-its-art-nouveau-architecture-5982737"&gt;art nouveau mass&lt;/a&gt;) is annoyed with the reconstruction. What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;PCs find out that a certain group (redheads, AAA game developers, 8-bit ambient music fans, people with calligraphic prints or enamel pitchers/vinyl records/knives bought at &lt;a href="http://attractions.topbudapest.org/markets/ecseri-flea-market/"&gt;the Ecseri flea market&lt;/a&gt;) are being registered by the authorities. (Perhaps one of the PCs is also among those targeted.) Investigation reveals that the people in question share some mystical bond, and that plans are in place to lock these people up in underground internment camps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;A massive &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/aug/13/worlds-largest-urban-farm-to-open-on-a-paris-rooftop"&gt;rooftop garden in the town centre&lt;/a&gt; is a major backdrop for scenes in the story: this is where an NPC always meets the PCs, or where some ransom is to be handed over, or shootout pursuit is staged, or one of the PCs lives in the building.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;A major NPC is moonlighting as a volunteer at an NGO helping the homeless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><category>plot-hook</category><category>premise</category><guid>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/08/themes-and-story-ideas/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2019 22:05:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Politics and society in Mage: The Budapest Urbancrawl</title><link>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/07/politics-and-society-in-budapest/</link><dc:creator>Bujna Balázs</dc:creator><description>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;The setting is finally given the post-communist cyberpunk feel it has been sorely missing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="1119" data-original-width="1600" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RUeFDsQ6nH0/XSjWCoqZ3aI/AAAAAAAA1xc/9T8W4D0__D0SACGqkG80defdhZQVKa1JQCLcBGAs/s320/helicopter.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@mehdisepehri?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"&gt;Mehdi Sepehri&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Political repression is very heavily implied by the magickal alternate Budapest setting laid out in this blog. &lt;a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/fleshing-out-premise-statement.html"&gt;The premise statement&lt;/a&gt; has words like dystopia, and Post-Communist, and political repression,  and Paradox is supposed to be "a metaphor for discrimination and  exclusion" - but so far, how or why exactly this political unease manifests itself has been left up to the GM.&lt;br&gt;This post aims to offer specifics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conditional Basic Income&lt;/h2&gt;The &lt;a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-technocracy-magical-premise.html"&gt;Danube above and around Budapest carries Quintessence&lt;/a&gt;, that is Primal Utility by another name, which the powers that be, or rather, the power behind the throne is tapping into to raise overall wealth levels for residents.&lt;br&gt;The explanation for why this wealthy society has become exclusionary, and xenophobic has so far been glossed over.&lt;br&gt;GMs could argue that Danube-borne Primal Utility is &lt;span class="tooltip" title="...or like EU funds for present-day Hungary, but this isn't a political blog, and similarities to real-life events or persons living or dead are strictly coincidental."&gt;like oil for Arabic Peninsula caliphates or aid/Chinese investment in Sub-Saharan Africa,&lt;/span&gt; and the wealth is mostly pocketed and squandered by those at the top. No-one is stopping you as GM from explaining the setting's paradox between its wealth and its repression in this way, but to me it feels like a cop-out.&lt;br&gt;The paradox is resolved by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income"&gt;Basic Income&lt;/a&gt;, as it is, &lt;span class="tooltip" title="I have no idea about either politics or economics, so I might be completely wrong."&gt;I think, misinterpreted and misrepresented&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://meanwhileinbudapest.com/2016/11/11/basic-income-will-inevitably-turn-against-you/"&gt;in this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;The city state government has used the upsurge of wealth after the damming of the Danube to grant everyone Conditional Basic Income (Alapjáradék &lt;span class="IPA"&gt;[ˈɒlɒp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;ˌjaːr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;ɒ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;ˌd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;eːk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Turning it up to 11 &lt;/h2&gt;Mage: The Budapest Urbancrawl takes that idea, and runs with it.&lt;br&gt;What if the government guarantees a basic income that comes with strings attached, such as&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;being a loyal citizen (maybe informers are given bonuses),&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;not rocking the boat, and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;having (or faking) the appropriate (political, social) outlook/attitude.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What if everyone gets money without having to work, but the amount you get is determined by how much you cleave to &lt;a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/05/the-szekeres-bara-life-system.html"&gt;the Szekeres-Bara Life System&lt;/a&gt;, what school you take your children to, how often do you volunteer for civic duty/neighbourhood watch, things like that?&lt;br&gt;Discrepancies in basic income levels would fuel the flames of jealousy and hatred between different social groups, and a universal mistrust of immigrants and scrounging freeloaders (anyone that's different).&lt;br&gt;Presto discrimination, exclusion, and self-sustaining social repression.&lt;br&gt;This, to me, is a valid (if highly unlikely and admittedly simplistic) dystopia without the internal discrepancies that threatened to unravel the whole setting, so Conditional Basic Income is, from now on, Mage: The Budapest Urbancrawl canon.</description><category>premise</category><guid>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/07/politics-and-society-in-budapest/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2019 21:16:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Szekeres-Bara Life System</title><link>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/05/the-szekeres-bara-life-system/</link><dc:creator>Bujna Balázs</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a more detailed write-up of the quasi-religious popular movement that has been developed and marketed by the new kids on the Budapest Technocracy block (&lt;a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-technocracy-magical-premise.html"&gt;the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Szövetkezet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (the Co-Operative), that has dominated the mainstream since the 2008 financial crisis hit the city&lt;/a&gt;), and which has taken Budapest by storm, fuelling spontaneous Paradox vortices around town. &lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="512" data-original-width="800" src="https://m.blog.hu/ca/cabe-2/image/_fp-07901.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Szekeres &lt;span class="IPA"&gt;[ˈsɛkɛrɛʃ] &lt;/span&gt;and Bara &lt;span class="IPA"&gt;[ˈbɒr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;ɒ&lt;/span&gt;] &lt;/span&gt;are  said to have been a pair of army neurologists who have laid down the principles of  the movement associated with them in a large tome entitled &lt;b&gt;Everyday Mind Control&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Although there are photos of them circulating in the press, there is no account of anyone ever meeting them - they might as well be the figment of some Co-Operative middle manager's imagination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tenets&lt;/h2&gt;There are universal principles that govern human beings' conscious and subconscious workings, which, when correctly understood and properly (re-)configured, can provide insights into a person's own mind, and, for the method's advanced practitioners, even into the minds of others.&lt;br&gt;These principles are laid out in the duo's cryptic, vague, and ultimately impenetrable massive magnum opus, which is possibly why no-one really understands them.&lt;br&gt;Lucky there is a handy 5-step digest that people can (and, for some, must) memorize.&lt;br&gt;Essentially it's a form of ritualized autosuggestion where you have to listen to some distinctive repetitive clicks while visualizing your body from a point above and slightly behind the top of your head (as though looking down from the top of a pointy hat you're wearing), or imagining an orange hovering at this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Personal &lt;/h3&gt;While someone is in this mildly hypnotized state, it is claimed, they can think more clearly, stay focussed, not get distracted, increase their mental workload, improve their memory and recall, speed read, type at amazing speeds, carry on multiple conversations in parallel, et cetera. &lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Interpersonal&lt;/h3&gt;Playing chess while 'in the Sz-B zone' can attune the practitioner to their opponent's brain waves - with enough practice, an accomplished user of the technique can 'see' a few moves ahead. There are chess clubs sprouting up everywhere,and especially schoolchildren are encouraged by state propaganda to take up chess as a hobby and practice with friends and family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="533" data-original-width="800" height="213" src="https://i1.wp.com/halasinfo.hu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sakk2.jpg?ssl=1"&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is said that a truly advanced &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sz-B-ista&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;ˈ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;ɛ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;beː&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;iʃtɒ&lt;/span&gt;] can decouple this limited form of telepathy from the game, and use it at will to read people's minds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sound&lt;/h2&gt;The repeated clicking sound necessary to the self-hypnosis should come from a custom handheld metal clicker that is in virtually every household now, but of course there's also a licensed app that produces just the right kind of clicks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Anti-Magick&lt;/h2&gt;Unbeknownst to the mind-enhancing citizenry, but perhaps not to the Technocratic influencers that designed the method, getting into the semi-hypnotized alpha state generates Paradox around the Sz-B practitioner.&lt;br&gt;Magick is more difficult around people 'in the zone', and the generated Paradox does not affect the mundane person, but willworkers that happen to be around her. This Paradox is quite long-lasting, and can even accumulate in places where there's been a lot of recent Szekeres-Bara activity, essentially rendering some places inaccessible to mages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Social effects&lt;/h2&gt;With the method so popular, whole swaths of the population at any one time are under the influence - some are simply dazed and can be considered drunk and woozy, having only succeeded in making themselves fall half asleep, but some people do report an increased alertness and mental acuity. There are more traffic accidents on the one hand, and more intelligent discussions, walking encyclopedias, and world-class chess players on the other.&lt;br&gt;Some paranoid mages also suggest that self-hypnotized people pop up on the Szövetkezet scanners in real time, pinpointing their location and broadcasting their surface thoughts, and that the whole idea behind the movement was to have a surveillance system spying on a population addicted to autosuggestion.</description><category>premise</category><guid>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/05/the-szekeres-bara-life-system/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2019 21:26:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Batthyány Circle - Traditionalist faction in Mage: The Budapest Urbancrawl, part 4</title><link>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/04/the-batthyanyi-circle-traditionalist/</link><dc:creator>Bujna Balázs</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;This is the last part in a series of high-level overviews of the 4 main Traditionalist factions in my Mage: The Budapest Urbancrawl campaign.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Batthyány Circle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="600" data-original-width="800" height="240" src="https://1.kerulet.ittlakunk.hu/files/ittlakunk/styles/large/public/upload/company/1256/batthyany_teri_vasarcsarnok7_ady_egykor.hu_.jpg?itok=m1ZMHEyB"&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Batthyány Market Hall's iconic clock&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a highly secretive and close-knit cabal centred around a magical contraption that generates Bitcoin or some equivalent cryptocurrency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Suri&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="540" data-original-width="600" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8uulW9RgW2s/XMRr0WUgN0I/AAAAAAAA1lM/Zc-1ieKeplky2G-dSUniqALVKIHUCIeXgCLcBGAs/s320/attractive-beautiful-beautiful-woman-1895161.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="level__left"&gt;&lt;div class="level__item"&gt;&lt;div class="js-copy-attribute-content rd__p rd__p--no-margin"&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/@charry-jin-921439?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=pexels"&gt;Charry Jin&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/bald-woman-touching-clear-glass-window-1895161/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=pexels"&gt;Pexels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;An opportunistic ascetic.&lt;br&gt;The bartender at the collective's market hall coffee shop - the public face of the group, at least the mundane public face.&lt;br&gt;She craves power, and she's milking Hanifa's infatuation with her for all its worth - not much, though, to be honest.&lt;br&gt;She knows Sebestyén Aba from childhood, they've been kidnapped and held for some time - by whom, where, and why, has never been established.&lt;br&gt;Though she isn't too hot about her, she does acknowledge Hanifa as her mentor and magickal teacher - in fact, many of her rotes require the presence and active collaboration of both Hanifa and Suri.&lt;br&gt;Miranda, she feels, is the only sane person around her, but it seems her friendship is hard to earn. &lt;br&gt;She's torn between being a wallflower and taking the limelight.&lt;br&gt;She feels she's destined for larger things than some petty and doomed resistance, as she sees it, but Hanifa doesn't think that she's ready to go it alone yet - if ever.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hanifa &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="600" height="213" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y-BGkTn2jqw/XMRuu28ej9I/AAAAAAAA1lo/L4i7k7W-3hwX7242cHsiCTcGzZYDXTyAwCLcBGAs/s320/hanifa.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Resistance guerilla, the leader of the collective.&lt;br&gt;She wants to build up a community, of wizards, lesbians, resistance fighters - whatever would work for her.&lt;br&gt;In love, perhaps too much so, with Suri, her student and protégé. The feeling isn't mutual, as she sometimes does admit to herself.&lt;br&gt;Sebestyén Aba is in fact her son, but she feels he's much too frivolous and hollow to be given the second-in-command status in the collective, or even to be left alone to his devices. It pains her that Sebestyén, for his part, is ashamed of her mum's to him grotesque magick and ways.&lt;br&gt;She saved Miranda's life, an accident, really, which is how they've met and decided to strike out as business partners.&lt;br&gt;She hopes Miranda's smallish network of sales acquaintances will somehow generate some mainstream appeal for her beliefs, and get that community going. It's a long shot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sebestyén Aba&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="735" data-original-width="600" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aO2ujJjrM74/XMRt49elprI/AAAAAAAA1lY/7MhTG47wYjs-VOPVptUz_1UGokhTOPgMgCLcBGAs/s320/sebestyen.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Flaneur chaos wizard.&lt;br&gt;The whole business, and and Hanifa's plans to topple the Syndicate's economic stranglehold over Budapest hinges on his cryptocurrency-generator, his own invention.&lt;br&gt;It's acceptance that he craves from his environment, even if his carefully groomed exterior is that of a well-dressed, work-shy wiseguy who sidesteps society’s rules to live as he pleases.&lt;br&gt;He's torn between his well-hidden inhibitions and his artistic ambitions as a celebrated street photographer.&lt;br&gt;He's ashamed of his mother, Hanifa, for ignoring their aristocratic heritage - he isn't going to make that mistake.&lt;br&gt;Miranda is his wife, who desires him viscerally, but whom he more or less ignores because he feels she's beneath her. It's a marriage of convenience.&lt;br&gt;He and Suri were kidnapped and held in some basement for a time - he doesn't remember much save for the darkness, the blinding lights that sometimes broke that darkness, and the pain. Perhaps they've been experimented on, but what matters more is that he has been in love with Suri ever since.

I have two reasons.&lt;br&gt;On the one hand, I would definitely do character generation (at least!) for any campaign in the setting using Dramasystem guidelines, and I would recommend it to anyone (I sadly wasn't yet aware of Robin D. Laws' system when I started with the present group.)&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, I feel formulating the setting in as many formats as I can certainly helps to get it across, so here goes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Q3v29XafSHw/XLnQyt1AkhI/AAAAAAAA1jw/1yBhcQpbefAebqYHHXTtXO0e442F7_fkACLcBGAs/s320/richard-bohus-762727-unsplash.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/yZDATZKDoOo?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"&gt;Richard Bohus&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@briczi?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nutshell&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Group of mages deal with infighting, and intrigue between their peer groups while surviving in an urban fantasy version of contemporary Budapest that is in many ways geared against magic-users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Setting&lt;/h2&gt; I've already detailed the history of the setting &lt;a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-technocracy-magical-premise.html"&gt;in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Andrássy Rifts&lt;/h3&gt; There's &lt;a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-andrassy-rifts-magical-premise.html"&gt;a previous post all about this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Paradox&lt;/h3&gt;Paradox in this setting is the metaphor for the unease,  hostility, and discrimination that mages elicit from non-magickal  society, and the system that is in control of that society.&lt;br&gt;To  bring this home fully, Paradox flaws and backlashes in this setting  tends to manifest as socially frowned-upon or debilitating conditions  such as stammering, epileptic seizure, motor impairment in limbs,  blindness or extreme myopia, facial scarring, etc.&lt;br&gt;Alternately, there could even exist a sort of 'wizards disease' such as color blindness, as a form of permanent paradox that afflicts all magickal people, and is a stigma: the basis of slurs and discrimination (so that, for example, mages have trouble differentiating between various banknotes without using magickal means).&lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Szekeres-Bara Theory of Self&lt;/h3&gt;(disclaimer: I'm still struggling with this component of the setting - I feel I need a sort of scam religion to justify and lend moral superiority to the establishment, but it seems coming up with a workable concept that fits the setting is more than I bargained for) &lt;br&gt;This is a state-sponsored and -endorsed human potential movement self-religion along the lines of Scientology, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arica_School"&gt;Arica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Seminars_Training"&gt;est&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Way"&gt;Gurdjieff School&lt;/a&gt;, and the like.&lt;br&gt;Detailed write-up planned!&lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Setting questions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How widespread and intense is this repression really? (Does it resemble in any way, shape, or form &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-45474279"&gt;the way Uighurs are treated in China&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do magickal people have to register? Are they prevented (in a magickal way disguised as technology) from entering certain areas?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;is there a secret police?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How ubiquitous is the propaganda machine?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a police state?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do mages have a person, symbol, or artifact to serve as the icon of their rebellion (like early Christians had the fish symbol)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How advanced is the technology?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How bleak and cyberpunk is the world?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are Technocratic agents a playable option?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the Technocracy irredeemably evil, are Technocrats just mistaken, or is the Technocracy also (if less enthusiastically and/or openly) fighting against the Powers that Be that they've helped set up but which has since outgrown them and their control?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are the Traditionalist/Disparate factions really a scourge to rid society of - are the PCs righteously resisting rebels, or deluded terrorists?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Characters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sample Roles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cabal Leader: probably has some dark secret - no-one can become an influencer with this recent history without having at least one unsavoury compromise in their past. Possibly also has dirt on one or more of his peers to keep them sweet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firebrand: possibly personally traumatised by the Technocracy (family disappeared, ambitions thwarted, blacklisted, imprisoned, etc.) and now seeking revenge; has only these milquetoast cabal-mates to rely on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rookie: has just awakened and been recruited to the cabal - still has trouble adjusting to being on the receiving end of all the unconscious discrimination that he's dished out as a 'normal' in his now-past life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technocracy Spy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acolyte: non-magickal sympathizer of the wizards' cause.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tourist Mage: came for the party, stayed for the party/The Party/Love/Ascension/War/?. An outcast within outcasts - Budapest mages on the whole don't take too kindly to outsiders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cabal Lieutenant: keeping the troops happy while vying for his boss's position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Specialist: an magickal academic/experimenter who couldn't care less about their social environment. Only interested in Ascension/on the cusp of a major breakthrough/etc.; a liability to the cabal as far as security and PR goes, but can they afford to let the Specialist go and die alone, or be recruited by another faction?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Martyr: the 'normals' need to know about the nature of reality even if they mock us as we try to teach them about it. Probably alone with such views within the cabal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Character build questions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How many of you are there in your cabal? What are the points of friction within the group?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How well do you feel your paradigm/Tradition/magickal support group is represented within the Budapest agglomeration?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is your opinion of the so-called "tourist mages" who come to fill up on all the Quintessence flowing about and then either settle or move on?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you think of the relatively large Chinese community in Budapest? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In what way do you personally feel marginalized in Budapest?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is your stance towards the Andrássy Rifts? Are they an opportunity or a source of danger to Budapest?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How important is Ascension in your life?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How important is your non-magickal family (if you have any non-magickal family) in your life?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;Francesco Rosi films, such as Cadaveri Eccelenti.&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="600" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9eONvq0kAbo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Themes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Survival &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Civil War&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Anti-)Terrorism &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Corruption Eats Your Soul&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resistance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trying for a Second Chance on a Missed Opportunity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Injustice &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treading Water&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paranoia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hope&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sense of Exclusion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We Can Do This, We Don't Need Anyone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dog Eat Dog&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tightening the Screws&lt;/h2&gt;Here's where &lt;a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/goals-and-obstacles-implied-by-premise.html"&gt;the Dark Secrets&lt;/a&gt; come in.&lt;br&gt;Throw them at your players when they seem to settle into a rut. &lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Names&lt;/h2&gt;Hungarian or Chinese family names.&lt;br&gt;Everyone is known only by their family name or "handle".

Every mage has heard of him/her, but there have been very few verified sightings. He/she spends most of their time in the Umbra, guarding &lt;a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-rudas-thermal-baths-location-npc.html"&gt;the Rudas Bath Horizon node&lt;/a&gt;, and, some say, the city as a whole from malevolent incursions. His name is, of course, not far from the lips of the thousands of Chinese descent living in Budapest - he is revered as a patron saint of sorts by the Chinese community, and might be a reason the minority isn't treated too badly by the otherwise quite nationalist council administration or the public.&lt;br&gt;In my game, he is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong"&gt;THE Sun Wukong&lt;/a&gt;, 'The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal', but I've limited his legendary abilities to the Near Umbra and beyond so as not unbalance the game - my players only met him once, and on Earth he's &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; an immortal Akashic master:)&lt;br&gt;There is only one other member of his Budapest 'cabal' (he might have several others going on all over the world, who knows) is Hegedűs &lt;span class="IPA"&gt;[ˈhɛɡɛdyːʃ]&lt;/span&gt;, his real-world representative, an actual academic. She's a materials scientist shaman whose paradigm is that the Umbra isn't 'outer space' but the magnified microcosm of stuff - when she awakens objects' spirits (a popular pastime) and communes across the Gauntlet, she uses microscopes and heavy-duty magnifying glasses, and delves into the gap between the barbs of feathers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-right: 1em; text-align: left; width: 100%;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="995" data-original-width="1024" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QqZuaPWBCP4/XKE6Px-K9SI/AAAAAAAA1hE/4djFkgsHt78MYsvddElqiNtPBESIgOctQCLcBGAs/s320/hegedus.jpg" width="320"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Hegedűs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The 'cabal' as such, then, doesn't really have a Budapest chantry, but Hegedűs can usually be reached at one of &lt;a href="http://egykor.hu/budapest-viii--kerulet/szazados-uti-muvesztelep/4007"&gt;the Százados Street Artist Colony&lt;/a&gt; houses - strictly for diplomatic business to be passed on to Majomkirály.&lt;br&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-right: 1em; text-align: left; width: 100%;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="995" data-original-width="1024" src="https://www.magyarkurir.hu/img.php?id=79266&amp;amp;v=1&amp;amp;img=o_1_.jpg" width="320"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Those who need to know will recognize this place.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><category>faction</category><category>NPC</category><category>premise</category><category>traditionalist magick</category><guid>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/04/the-cabal-of-monkey-king-traditionalist/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2019 23:34:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Goals, Obstacles, and Dark Secret options</title><link>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/03/goals-and-obstacles-implied-by-premise/</link><dc:creator>Bujna Balázs</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Thinking further about what &lt;a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/fleshing-out-premise-statement.html"&gt;the Premise Statement&lt;/a&gt; implies, still following &lt;a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/184668/Setting-Design-Black-Box-Edition"&gt;the Setting Design book&lt;/a&gt;, I'd like to detail the potential goals of &lt;a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/characters-implied-by-premise-statement.html"&gt;the characters that fit the premise&lt;/a&gt;, and the obstacles that make their lives interesting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;The initial goals, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis,_antithesis,_synthesis"&gt;the "thesis" of the campaign&lt;/a&gt;, if you will, will be quite mundane - make ends meet, be able to practice your magick in peace/unharassed,  not go to jail, help friends not go to jail, try to get rich off some magickal artifact looted (at great personal danger) from a villa in the Andrássy Rifts, pay through the nose for such an artifact, be hired by one of the Chinese Tongs for an odd job, etc. Routine stuff to familiarize the players and the GM with the setting.&lt;br&gt;(I'm assuming the PCs start out already Awakened, and members of the same cabal.) &lt;br&gt;Once the dark secret is revealed to the PCs, the meat-and-potatoes goals (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis,_antithesis,_synthesis"&gt;"anti-thesis"&lt;/a&gt;) come into play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="503" data-original-width="770" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zUK3q3AQl6I/XJZiUKRzgfI/AAAAAAAA1bs/OP2_DUkZcAUr-G8tE8-NMPXHXeYcpfPywCLcBGAs/s640/3305731-ZXHAUJFB-32.jpg" style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some spoilers for potential dark secrets in the setting: &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turns out the leader of the city's foremost cabal has been a &lt;a href="http://forum.theonyxpath.com/forum/main-category/main-forum/the-classic-world-of-darkness/mage-the-ascension/98768-how-to-build-a-golem"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt; for quite some time now, controlled by ??? Who knows this other than the PCs? Who stands to benefit? Perhaps everything you knew about the Technocrats vis-a-vis the Traditions in Budapest is a lie? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Andrássy Rifts have actually been monitored by the Void Engineers from the moment the villa portals were 'abandoned'. Why did they decide to filter out only the nasty Nephandi to protect the city, instead of cleaning up the whole place?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elections are coming, and there finally seems to be a viable opposition candidate to stand up against the incumbent authoritarian administration. Mages all around town are campaigning for the guy/girl - then, the PCs find out the candidate is a Nephandi ally. What can they do? Will anyone believe them?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The PCs accidentally find out that the hyped and shiny AIs that drive cars, manage traffic, surveillance, and high-end homes are in fact harvested human souls. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The actual PC goals will depend on the specifics of the dark secret, but generally they will&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;escape/fight off the faction(s) that know that they know (if any), and want the secret to stay secret;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;investigate the mystery/conspiracy behind the dark secret - think &lt;a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoylentGreen"&gt;"Soylent Green is PEOPLE!"&lt;/a&gt; - to understand their own new situation, having found out;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;decide whether/how to make the secret public or to take over from the original conspirators and reap the benefits;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;implement plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="1066" data-original-width="1600" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-agBkLYPDvvk/WzJNrsUEENI/AAAAAAAADj4/x-53uKdYwY0x9m5ALDCsxNpOOOVsqfD1ACLcBGAs/s640/STREET%2BIN%2BBUDAPEST%2B24%2BX%2B36.JPG" style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Obstacles&lt;/h2&gt;It's the status quo that the characters are up against, all along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Their mundane goals are hindered by the institutions and social norms that are set against them - &lt;a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/fleshing-out-premise-statement.html"&gt;objectified by Paradox&lt;/a&gt;, but also the general ambience. Everyone around the city is quick to label people that look or act unusual or weird - 'hipster', 'faggot', 'tree-hugger', 'junky', 'wacko', 'birth tourist', 'imbecile', 'crank', 'freak', 'lunatic fringe', plus all the ethnic, ageist, body-shaming and other slurs are bandied about.&lt;br&gt;The resentment and turned-up noses are just the tip of the iceberg of &lt;a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Jim+Crowism"&gt;general discrimination&lt;/a&gt; - police stop mages more often, they're less likely to find, keep, or earn the same wage for a job. A sort of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_profiling"&gt;racial profiling&lt;/a&gt; against non-conformists.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then, when the dark secret is out, it's once again the status quo that doesn't want them rocking the boat - whoever is implicated in the conspiracy/mystery will do everything in their power to stop the PCs acting on the revelation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><category>premise</category><guid>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/03/goals-and-obstacles-implied-by-premise/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2019 20:33:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Characters implied by the Premise Statement</title><link>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/03/characters-implied-by-premise-statement/</link><dc:creator>Bujna Balázs</dc:creator><description>&lt;a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/fleshing-out-premise-statement.html"&gt;The Premise Statement (and the setting's central metaphor)&lt;/a&gt; limits PC options for players to be mages.

that reality-bending will-workers accumulate when their magick goes against consensual reality is a metaphor for discrimination and exclusion - the 'tyranny of the majority' that scorns and derides any occurrence of 'the Other'.&lt;br&gt;Mages, by extension, stand in for all types of 'out-of-the-ordinary', non-mainstream, non-middle-class, non-heterosexual, that a Technocracy-affected society rejects. &lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Premise Statement&lt;/h2&gt;An assorted cabal of mages in a contemporary dystopia; an alternate-history Post-Communist Budapest, is trying to get by, combatting intrigue, political repression, and social exclusion, when they discover a dark secret that would change the status quo if revealed, and must decide what to do about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

He was all but adopted by the Schiffer cabal leader, who had been grooming him as his successor. But then &lt;span class="tootlip" title="A media blunder revealed that there are at least one clone of the Prime Minister. It took massive resources to frame it as an urban myth instead of proven fact."&gt;the Havassy-incident&lt;/span&gt; happened, and Krausz felt that his composer mentor's active role in the government cover-up was unconscionable&lt;br&gt;He has been recruiting his former cabal-mates from the Schiffer group with the promise of amassing 'a real Resistance movement', one that won't be afraid to rock the boat.&lt;br&gt;Although he did manage to convince a handful of mages, some in the newly minted collective suspect that 'the Resistance' will not amount to more than sitting around in the cabal's top-secret new chantry on the top floor of the Hotel Budapest, moping about Krausz's ex-wife, and cursing the Schiffer cabal leader.&lt;br&gt;Krausz might not be cut out to be a revolutionary, but his inventions are formidable, and his social network must be vast - he managed to kit out almost half the very top floor of &lt;a href="https://www.danubiushotels.com/en/our-hotels-budapest/hotel-budapest"&gt;the Hotel Budapest&lt;/a&gt; as a clandestine cabal headquarters with magickal detectors scanning as far as the river Danube. (At a safe distance from his former mentor's hideout.)</description><category>faction</category><category>NPC</category><category>premise</category><category>traditionalist magick</category><guid>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/03/the-circle-collective-traditionalist/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2019 17:09:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
