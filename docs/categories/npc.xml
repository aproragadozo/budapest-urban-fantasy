He is the main employer for people living in the district, directly or indirectly, through shell companies. Very many people's livelihood depends on not getting on his wrong side.

He's popular, then; people grumble, but vote for him time and again.&lt;br&gt;GMs might equally make him out to be either a sinister figure (that is, a Szövetkezet technocrat or someone influenced by a Syndicate advisor), or a well-meaning man-of-the-people corrupted and turned into little more than a mobster by power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Plot hook&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasty-looking, extremely ripe mangoes turn up at fire-sale prices in recently opened outlet of supermarket chain that was hyped in all the local media.

Perhaps it was the building technology, quite unique in the district (the building is actually not a prefab at all)? Perhaps it was that the high-rise was meant to be the iconic symbol of the district, and the intention was a success beyond the city planners' wildest dreams? However it happened, the building's spirit woke up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Personality &lt;/h2&gt;It has, from Day 1, considered itself a sort of guardian or mother figure&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;to its 'little siblings', that is, the bunches of 10-story prefabs that stream out from its hub like the spokes of a wheel,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to the tiny little people with the exotic little consciousness-blobs hanging around them,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to the trees, playgrounds, statues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;After all, it had been its duty to supply nurturing, cleaning, refreshing, sustaining drinking water to most of them. (The building was a functioning water tower for only ten years after being erected.)&lt;br&gt;In exchange for favours, the tower spirit always asks for some quest to be undertaken to help the district in a specific or general way - clean up park, replace lock, make crossing in front of kindergarten safe, find key/pet parrot/lost cat and return it to owner, prevent suicide, prevent local branch of library from getting cut from next year's budget, etc.&lt;br&gt;However, to this day the water pipes act as a surveillance network of sorts through which the Water Tower High-Rise has psychic access to a surprisingly large proportion of the district's built environment - the specifics of this link is left to Storyteller discretion.&lt;br&gt;What is certain, however, is that to make use of the effect, a mage needs to enter the former cisterns at the very top of the tower, either physically, or in the Penumbra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gate-keeper&lt;/h2&gt;The erstwhile cisterns have been remodelled into two large studio flats, inside one of which lives, rent-free, Harsányi (&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;ˈhɒrʃaːɲ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;]), the council-sponsored caretaker of the high-rise.

The feeling isn't mutual, as she sometimes does admit to herself.&lt;br&gt;Sebestyén Aba is in fact her son, but she feels he's much too frivolous and hollow to be given the second-in-command status in the collective, or even to be left alone to his devices. It pains her that Sebestyén, for his part, is ashamed of her mum's to him grotesque magick and ways.&lt;br&gt;She saved Miranda's life, an accident, really, which is how they've met and decided to strike out as business partners.&lt;br&gt;She hopes Miranda's smallish network of sales acquaintances will somehow generate some mainstream appeal for her beliefs, and get that community going.

It's a marriage of convenience.&lt;br&gt;He and Suri were kidnapped and held in some basement for a time - he doesn't remember much save for the darkness, the blinding lights that sometimes broke that darkness, and the pain. Perhaps they've been experimented on, but what matters more is that he has been in love with Suri ever since. Suri is a coy tease, and apparently hasn't yet made up his mind about whether to enter into an affair - any way, it will end badly for Sebestyén, a fact he's blissfully unaware of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Miranda&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="715" data-original-width="600" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S_3mFrSZfk0/XMRuKsNZnwI/AAAAAAAA1lg/ALhkBxHJHFMCg_SAYUjrhZ4k3drPHSH7QCLcBGAs/s320/miranda.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="level__left"&gt;&lt;div class="level__item"&gt;&lt;div class="js-copy-attribute-content rd__p rd__p--no-margin"&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/@oleg-magni?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=pexels"&gt;Oleg Magni&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/portrait-of-curly-haired-girl-918474/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=pexels"&gt;Pexels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whimsical New Age witch.&lt;br&gt;Recovered alcoholic, driven to suicide that Hanifa prevented, has been immensely grateful ever since, now that they've become business partners with her mother-in-law, she's not so sure.&lt;br&gt;What she wants more than anything is comfort and calm, but her life is still quite tumultuous, what with the husband who has eyes for the stunning and impassive bartender, and her coffee shop being taken over for spreading anti-establishment propaganda. I guess she's the sort of person who always wants to take charge of her life but relies on others too much to pull it off.&lt;br&gt;She's a bit taken aback by Suri's advances - does she really think she would be best buddies with the chick her husband wants to bang instead of her?

It was inevitable that a semi-official market-place should spring up for people looking for magickal knick-knacks. In fact, this market-place was bound to be somewhere on &lt;a href="https://www.budapestbylocals.com/margaret-island.html"&gt;Margaret Island&lt;/a&gt; (Margit-sziget [&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;ˈmɒrɡit,&lt;/span&gt;siɡɛt&lt;/span&gt;]), smack in the middle of the stretch of Danube dividing the city into Buda and Pest, with magickal waters flowing around it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="600" src="https://www.legifoto.com/files/margitsziget.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The island itself, on account of the ever-replenishing Quintessence that the Danube around it carries 24-7, is an oasis for not just mages - people are unconsciously drawn to the place and enjoy the natural high that comes with magic literally being in the air.&lt;br&gt;There are joggers, families with children, and anyone aching for the outdoors; there's a swimming pool, a petting zoo, and no internal combustion engines are allowed in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The market&lt;/h2&gt;The 'market' itself is as unassuming as can be - two floating pier sheds full of kayaks, boats, oars, and other boating and kayaking gear on the left-hand side of the photo above (facing the Buda side). They belong to the Budapest Boating Association with a HQ on the opposite side of the island, and only a handful of people know about the sheds' more mystical purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="600" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EOD25jnvIlw/XK9Dt9lqLmI/AAAAAAAA1iY/TTLUyTEfGSYLkOh3w6WXvM7ZtJx-DPvwgCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20190411_153612_534.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;View of the kayak and boating paraphernalia sheds that double as the market-place from the Pest quay&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you know the right passphrase, look familiar to the two 'shopkeepers', or seem like you need an item to help you out (or deserve an item that brings you misery), you will find that the sheds in fact are crammed full of the most interesting magickal stuff, large and small.&lt;br&gt;Customers are normally charged a small quest in exchange for items.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gulyás and Hóbor, the shopkeepers&lt;/h2&gt;They're really a two-man Euthanatos cabal who have taken it upon themselves to better the world by controlling the distribution of harmful and beneficial magic items.&lt;br&gt;Gulyás (&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;[ˈɡujaːʃ]) is the younger one of the pair, in his twenties, handsome, quiet, brooding, and in fact very manipulative, especially of Hóbor (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;[ˈhoːbor]&lt;/span&gt;), the nominal leader of their little cult. In fact, he's the 'power behind the throne' - Hóbor rarely admits it to himself, but he's head over heels in love with his young ward, and will do anything to keep him by his side. Gulyás is part of the gardening crew on the island, and has a uniform and a pass that gets him access to virtually anywhere on Margit-sziget. The quests he likes to set for people who come looking for talismans and wonders slowly but surely build a web of contacts and information with him sitting in the middle, a fat spider pulling the strings, a but like Leland Gaunt in Needful Things.

He can't hold down a decent job on account of his missing left arm, but the boating association keeps him on as watchmen/groundsman. He keeps bees - all the bees on the island come from one of his hives, tucked in nooks and crannies - and he likes to command them into clouds and direct them around like some Biblical prophet. He can take over the swarm's senses and so finds out about a surprising many things even though he never leaves the island.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;Sample items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="IPA"&gt;Pair of scissors.

Every mage has heard of him/her, but there have been very few verified sightings. He/she spends most of their time in the Umbra, guarding &lt;a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-rudas-thermal-baths-location-npc.html"&gt;the Rudas Bath Horizon node&lt;/a&gt;, and, some say, the city as a whole from malevolent incursions. His name is, of course, not far from the lips of the thousands of Chinese descent living in Budapest - he is revered as a patron saint of sorts by the Chinese community, and might be a reason the minority isn't treated too badly by the otherwise quite nationalist council administration or the public.&lt;br&gt;In my game, he is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong"&gt;THE Sun Wukong&lt;/a&gt;, 'The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal', but I've limited his legendary abilities to the Near Umbra and beyond so as not unbalance the game - my players only met him once, and on Earth he's &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; an immortal Akashic master:)&lt;br&gt;There is only one other member of his Budapest 'cabal' (he might have several others going on all over the world, who knows) is Hegedűs &lt;span class="IPA"&gt;[ˈhɛɡɛdyːʃ]&lt;/span&gt;, his real-world representative, an actual academic. She's a materials scientist shaman whose paradigm is that the Umbra isn't 'outer space' but the magnified microcosm of stuff - when she awakens objects' spirits (a popular pastime) and communes across the Gauntlet, she uses microscopes and heavy-duty magnifying glasses, and delves into the gap between the barbs of feathers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-right: 1em; text-align: left; width: 100%;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="995" data-original-width="1024" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QqZuaPWBCP4/XKE6Px-K9SI/AAAAAAAA1hE/4djFkgsHt78MYsvddElqiNtPBESIgOctQCLcBGAs/s320/hegedus.jpg" width="320"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Hegedűs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The 'cabal' as such, then, doesn't really have a Budapest chantry, but Hegedűs can usually be reached at one of &lt;a href="http://egykor.hu/budapest-viii--kerulet/szazados-uti-muvesztelep/4007"&gt;the Százados Street Artist Colony&lt;/a&gt; houses - strictly for diplomatic business to be passed on to Majomkirály.&lt;br&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-right: 1em; text-align: left; width: 100%;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="995" data-original-width="1024" src="https://www.magyarkurir.hu/img.php?id=79266&amp;amp;v=1&amp;amp;img=o_1_.jpg" width="320"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Those who need to know will recognize this place.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><category>faction</category><category>NPC</category><category>premise</category><category>traditionalist magick</category><guid>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/04/the-cabal-of-monkey-king-traditionalist/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2019 23:34:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Rudas Thermal Baths - Location, NPC, Plot Hooks</title><link>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/03/the-rudas-thermal-baths-location-npc/</link><dc:creator>Bujna Balázs</dc:creator><description>&lt;a href="http://en.rudasfurdo.hu/"&gt;Rudas Baths (pronounced something like "Roux Dosh" ([ˈrudɒʃ]))&lt;/a&gt; is one of the Turkish-style bath houses in Budapest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://i1.wp.com/welovebudapest.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/Rudas-Fu%CC%88rdo%CC%8B_Bo%CC%81dis-Krisztia%CC%81n_006.jpg?resize=1200%2C720&amp;amp;ssl=1" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="480" data-original-width="800" height="192" src="https://i1.wp.com/welovebudapest.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/Rudas-Fu%CC%88rdo%CC%8B_Bo%CC%81dis-Krisztia%CC%81n_006.jpg?resize=1200%2C720&amp;amp;ssl=1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the M:TBU setting, it is a location much like &lt;a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Digital_Web_(book)"&gt;the Spy's Demise BBS detailed in Digital Web&lt;/a&gt;: perhaps the only place in town where the Awakened and Enlightened of any stripe can come together and talk without fear of aggression. By mutual agreement, Technocrats and Traditionalist, hell, even upstart Disparates, can rub shoulders here and chat.&lt;br&gt;How is that possible?&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Location&lt;/h1&gt; The waters of  the Rudas Thermal Bath are heavily &lt;a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_(MTAs)"&gt;Prime-infused&lt;/a&gt; and serves as the basis of an implicit truce - no need to fight when there's plenty of the good stuff for everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Baths are ideal for making plans, diplomatic encounters, trying to ferret out the enemies plans, subtle backstabbing, building up or losing face, or just to lay back &amp;amp; soak up Quintessence in wondrous environment.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;I like to play up the intoxicating nature of this  naturally-occurring Quintessence so that getting wet is like having a  few beers. You get giddy if you save your saving throw.&lt;/h4&gt;(Mechanically, I give everyone who stays at least an hour in the water d10/2 temporary Quintessence - they only find out how much when they leave, and it's lost if not used up within 24 hours. That's not a tamper proof rule, but what is?)&lt;br&gt;The explanation is that there's a Horizon node with a portal somewhere inside &lt;a href="https://welovebudapest.com/en/venue/gellert-hill-2/"&gt;Gellért Hill&lt;/a&gt;, where the magickal water springs from. Its location is a secret guarded from everyone, including their Traditionalist peers, by &lt;span class="tooltip" title="To be covered in a future post."&gt;the Monkey King Collective,&lt;/span&gt; a small cabal of semi-rogue Budapest mages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;If the spring fell into the wrong hands, the fallout would be devastating.&lt;/h4&gt;Though the Technocracy pays lip-service to the agreement that everyone has equal rights to the magick water, they still keep trying to covertly find the Rudas Node - and some would say every single other faction is after the Node too. &lt;a href="https://www.xpatloop.com/channels/2018/09/gellert-hill-funicular-under-construction.html"&gt;There is a funicular secretly being built that would carve into the side of the hill&lt;/a&gt; - it's an open secret that this is a smokescreen to cover the search for the Node, but no-one is sure who is behind the project.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h1&gt;NPC&lt;/h1&gt;Everyone who's been to the place more than twice knows Béla (&lt;span class="st"&gt;[ˈbeːlɒ]) (and he will definitely know regulars by name), the affable if moody locker room attendant who some think might be &lt;a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Extraordinary_Citizen"&gt;an Extraordinary Citizen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product_info.php?products_id=19&amp;amp;it=1&amp;amp;language=es&amp;amp;"&gt;a consor&lt;/a&gt;. The amount of magickal activity he must have been exposed to in his decades on the job could have affected him, but others think he's actually 'repelling magick and/or Paradox', arguing that he couldn't have survived. Anyways, he's a talking point among bath patrons - an ice-breaker when at a loss for what to say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="st"&gt;He's got a no-nonsense attitude and never gets fazed by anything - he sure acts like he's seen it all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="480" data-original-width="800" height="192" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/19/16/10005514-6720971-image-a-7_1550595563042.jpg"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Béla, locker room attendant&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;He could be a fixer, a concierge, a messenger, a procurer of under-the-counter goods and/or a fountainhead of gossip for your PCs.&lt;br&gt;In my game he's a decidedly non-magickal ex-con who's got the cushy job in exchange for regular reports to &lt;a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-technocracy-magical-premise.html"&gt;the people in the Szabadság Square bunkers&lt;/a&gt;. His job description includes turning a blind eye to the shenanigans of mages high on Quintessence, and taking notes, but he likes bribes, and anyone who helps his daughter (a stunning and bubbly ballerina who tends to get mixed up in trouble) has a place in his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Plot Hook&lt;/h1&gt;These are variations on "protect the water", but there's always the Nephandus plot that subtly taints the water to cause strife and overdoses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magick is no protection against encroaching bureaucracy - council plans to shut down the place temporarily or to modify its water source (!) must be stopped by hook or by crook. Legal, illegal, or magickal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The bath-house is being renovated, and builders find a Wonder or a portal (could it be the sought-after link to the Node?). Technocrats and Mages need to band together to overcome the inevitable pointing of fingers and point-scoring to hush up the discovery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The water starts to ebb. What's up? Foul play in Budapest, or some trouble over at the Horizon end?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><category>location</category><category>NPC</category><category>plot-hook</category><guid>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/03/the-rudas-thermal-baths-location-npc/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2019 21:48:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Circle Collective  - Traditionalist factions in Mage: The Budapest Urbancrawl</title><link>http://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/posts/2019/03/the-circle-collective-traditionalist/</link><dc:creator>Bujna Balázs</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;This is part two in a 4-part series of high-level overviews of the main Traditionalist factions in my Mage: The Budapest Urbancrawl campaign.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Circle Collective&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-right: 1em; text-align: left; width: 100%;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://egykor.hu/images/2010/preview/budapest-ii-kerulet-hotel-budapest-korszallo-_6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="407" data-original-width="240" height="640" src="https://egykor.hu/images/2010/preview/budapest-ii-kerulet-hotel-budapest-korszallo-_6.jpg" width="376"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gu1mwT2TojgRMIBvrhwy-6zJV4L59s8X&amp;amp;usp=sharing"&gt;Hotel Budapest a.k.a the Circle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Led by an Etherite, a former close associate of the Schiffer cabal's  leader, who has been estranged from his old friend but still maintains  an uneasy alliance with the Schiffer cabal.&lt;br&gt;So much so that the two  collectives actually share their primary headquarters - Villa Schiffer.&lt;br&gt;Given that the Circle Collective's ex-Iteration X-er, currently Etherite leader basically single-handedly invented the Quintessence-machine huffing and puffing in the Villa Schiffer basement, the two cabals are effectively stuck with each other no matter how the two groups' leaders feel.&lt;br&gt;Krausz, the group's head is ex-military, and defected from Iteration-X after a bungled Iraqi mission that got his beloved wife killed - he is adamant that the Convention had a hand in her death, and vowed revenge. He was all but adopted by the Schiffer cabal leader, who had been grooming him as his successor. But then &lt;span class="tootlip" title="A media blunder revealed that there are at least one clone of the Prime Minister.
