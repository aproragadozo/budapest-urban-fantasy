<img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="540" data-original-width="600" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8uulW9RgW2s/XMRr0WUgN0I/AAAAAAAA1lM/Zc-1ieKeplky2G-dSUniqALVKIHUCIeXgCLcBGAs/s320/attractive-beautiful-beautiful-woman-1895161.png"><br><div class="level__left"><div class="level__item"><div class="js-copy-attribute-content rd__p rd__p--no-margin">Photo by <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@charry-jin-921439?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Charry Jin</a> from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/bald-woman-touching-clear-glass-window-1895161/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Pexels</a><br>An opportunistic ascetic.<br>The bartender at the collective's market hall coffee shop - the public face of the group, at least the mundane public face.<br>She craves power, and she's milking Hanifa's infatuation with her for all its worth - not much, though, to be honest.<br>She knows Sebestyén Aba from childhood, they've been kidnapped and held for some time - by whom, where, and why, has never been established.<br>Though she isn't too hot about her, she does acknowledge Hanifa as her mentor and magickal teacher - in fact, many of her rotes require the presence and active collaboration of both Hanifa and Suri.<br>Miranda, she feels, is the only sane person around her, but it seems her friendship is hard to earn. <br>She's torn between being a wallflower and taking the limelight.<br>She feels she's destined for larger things than some petty and doomed resistance, as she sees it, but Hanifa doesn't think that she's ready to go it alone yet - if ever.</div></div></div>
<h3>Hanifa </h3>
<img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="600" height="213" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y-BGkTn2jqw/XMRuu28ej9I/AAAAAAAA1lo/L4i7k7W-3hwX7242cHsiCTcGzZYDXTyAwCLcBGAs/s320/hanifa.png"><br>Resistance guerilla, the leader of the collective.<br>She wants to build up a community, of wizards, lesbians, resistance fighters - whatever would work for her.<br>In love, perhaps too much so, with Suri, her student and protégé. The feeling isn't mutual, as she sometimes does admit to herself.<br>Sebestyén Aba is in fact her son, but she feels he's much too frivolous and hollow to be given the second-in-command status in the collective, or even to be left alone to his devices. It pains her that Sebestyén, for his part, is ashamed of her mum's to him grotesque magick and ways.<br>She saved Miranda's life, an accident, really, which is how they've met and decided to strike out as business partners.<br>She hopes Miranda's smallish network of sales acquaintances will somehow generate some mainstream appeal for her beliefs, and get that community going. It's a long shot. <br><h3>Sebestyén Aba</h3>
<img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="735" data-original-width="600" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aO2ujJjrM74/XMRt49elprI/AAAAAAAA1lY/7MhTG47wYjs-VOPVptUz_1UGokhTOPgMgCLcBGAs/s320/sebestyen.png"><br>Flaneur chaos wizard.<br>The whole business, and and Hanifa's plans to topple the Syndicate's economic stranglehold over Budapest hinges on his cryptocurrency-generator, his own invention.<br>It's acceptance that he craves from his environment, even if his carefully groomed exterior is that of a well-dressed, work-shy wiseguy who sidesteps society’s rules to live as he pleases.<br>He's torn between his well-hidden inhibitions and his artistic ambitions as a celebrated street photographer.<br>He's ashamed of his mother, Hanifa, for ignoring their aristocratic heritage - he isn't going to make that mistake.<br>Miranda is his wife, who desires him viscerally, but whom he more or less ignores because he feels she's beneath her. It's a marriage of convenience.<br>He and Suri were kidnapped and held in some basement for a time - he doesn't remember much save for the darkness, the blinding lights that sometimes broke that darkness, and the pain. Perhaps they've been experimented on, but what matters more is that he has been in love with Suri ever since. Suri is a coy tease, and apparently hasn't yet made up his mind about whether to enter into an affair - any way, it will end badly for Sebestyén, a fact he's blissfully unaware of.<br><h3> Miranda</h3>

I guess she's the sort of person who always wants to take charge of her life but relies on others too much to pull it off.<br>She's a bit taken aback by Suri's advances - does she really think she would be best buddies with the chick her husband wants to bang instead of her? When she stays faithful even when she could have any man (true, she does have a sort of magnetism)?</div></div></div>
