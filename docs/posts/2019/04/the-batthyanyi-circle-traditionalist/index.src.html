The feeling isn't mutual, as she sometimes does admit to herself.<br>Sebestyén Aba is in fact her son, but she feels he's much too frivolous and hollow to be given the second-in-command status in the collective, or even to be left alone to his devices. It pains her that Sebestyén, for his part, is ashamed of her mum's to him grotesque magick and ways.<br>She saved Miranda's life, an accident, really, which is how they've met and decided to strike out as business partners.<br>She hopes Miranda's smallish network of sales acquaintances will somehow generate some mainstream appeal for her beliefs, and get that community going. It's a long shot. <br><h3>Sebestyén Aba</h3><img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="735" data-original-width="600" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aO2ujJjrM74/XMRt49elprI/AAAAAAAA1lY/7MhTG47wYjs-VOPVptUz_1UGokhTOPgMgCLcBGAs/s320/sebestyen.png"><br>Flaneur chaos wizard.<br>The whole business, and and Hanifa's plans to topple the Syndicate's economic stranglehold over Budapest hinges on his cryptocurrency-generator, his own invention.<br>It's acceptance that he craves from his environment, even if his carefully groomed exterior is that of a well-dressed, work-shy wiseguy who sidesteps society’s rules to live as he pleases.<br>He's torn between his well-hidden inhibitions and his artistic ambitions as a celebrated street photographer.<br>He's ashamed of his mother, Hanifa, for ignoring their aristocratic heritage - he isn't going to make that mistake.<br>Miranda is his wife, who desires him viscerally, but whom he more or less ignores because he feels she's beneath her. It's a marriage of convenience.<br>He and Suri were kidnapped and held in some basement for a time - he doesn't remember much save for the darkness, the blinding lights that sometimes broke that darkness, and the pain. Perhaps they've been experimented on, but what matters more is that he has been in love with Suri ever since. Suri is a coy tease, and apparently hasn't yet made up his mind about whether to enter into an affair - any way, it will end badly for Sebestyén, a fact he's blissfully unaware of.<br><h3> Miranda</h3><img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="715" data-original-width="600" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S_3mFrSZfk0/XMRuKsNZnwI/AAAAAAAA1lg/ALhkBxHJHFMCg_SAYUjrhZ4k3drPHSH7QCLcBGAs/s320/miranda.png"><br><div class="level__left"><div class="level__item"><div class="js-copy-attribute-content rd__p rd__p--no-margin">Photo by <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@oleg-magni?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Oleg Magni</a> from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/portrait-of-curly-haired-girl-918474/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Pexels</a><br>Whimsical New Age witch.<br>Recovered alcoholic, driven to suicide that Hanifa prevented, has been immensely grateful ever since, now that they've become business partners with her mother-in-law, she's not so sure.<br>What she wants more than anything is comfort and calm, but her life is still quite tumultuous, what with the husband who has eyes for the stunning and impassive bartender, and her coffee shop being taken over for spreading anti-establishment propaganda. I guess she's the sort of person who always wants to take charge of her life but relies on others too much to pull it off.<br>She's a bit taken aback by Suri's advances - does she really think she would be best buddies with the chick her husband wants to bang instead of her? When she stays faithful even when she could have any man (true, she does have a sort of magnetism)?</div></div></div></body></html>
