Every mage has heard of him/her, but there have been very few verified sightings. He/she spends most of their time in the Umbra, guarding <a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-rudas-thermal-baths-location-npc.html">the Rudas Bath Horizon node</a>, and, some say, the city as a whole from malevolent incursions. His name is, of course, not far from the lips of the thousands of Chinese descent living in Budapest - he is revered as a patron saint of sorts by the Chinese community, and might be a reason the minority isn't treated too badly by the otherwise quite nationalist council administration or the public.<br>In my game, he is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong">THE Sun Wukong</a>, 'The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal', but I've limited his legendary abilities to the Near Umbra and beyond so as not unbalance the game - my players only met him once, and on Earth he's <i>just</i> an immortal Akashic master:)<br>There is only one other member of his Budapest 'cabal' (he might have several others going on all over the world, who knows) is Hegedűs <span class="IPA">[ˈhɛɡɛdyːʃ]</span>, his real-world representative, an actual academic. She's a materials scientist shaman whose paradigm is that the Umbra isn't 'outer space' but the magnified microcosm of stuff - when she awakens objects' spirits (a popular pastime) and communes across the Gauntlet, she uses microscopes and heavy-duty magnifying glasses, and delves into the gap between the barbs of feathers.<br><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-right: 1em; text-align: left; width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="995" data-original-width="1024" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QqZuaPWBCP4/XKE6Px-K9SI/AAAAAAAA1hE/4djFkgsHt78MYsvddElqiNtPBESIgOctQCLcBGAs/s320/hegedus.jpg" width="320"></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Hegedűs</td></tr></tbody></table>The 'cabal' as such, then, doesn't really have a Budapest chantry, but Hegedűs can usually be reached at one of <a href="http://egykor.hu/budapest-viii--kerulet/szazados-uti-muvesztelep/4007">the Százados Street Artist Colony</a> houses - strictly for diplomatic business to be passed on to Majomkirály.<br><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-right: 1em; text-align: left; width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="995" data-original-width="1024" src="https://www.magyarkurir.hu/img.php?id=79266&amp;v=1&amp;img=o_1_.jpg" width="320"></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Those who need to know will recognize this place.</td></tr></tbody></table><br></body></html>
