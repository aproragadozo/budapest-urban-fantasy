                    <p>Thinking further about what <a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/fleshing-out-premise-statement.html">the Premise Statement</a> implies, still following <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/184668/Setting-Design-Black-Box-Edition">the Setting Design book</a>, I'd like to detail the potential goals of <a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/characters-implied-by-premise-statement.html">the characters that fit the premise</a>, and the obstacles that make their lives interesting.<br></p>
<h2>Goals</h2>The initial goals, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis,_antithesis,_synthesis">the "thesis" of the campaign</a>, if you will, will be quite mundane - make ends meet, be able to practice your magick in peace/unharassed,  not go to jail, help friends not go to jail, try to get rich off some magickal artifact looted (at great personal danger) from a villa in the Andrássy Rifts, pay through the nose for such an artifact, be hired by one of the Chinese Tongs for an odd job, etc. Routine stuff to familiarize the players and the GM with the setting.<br>(I'm assuming the PCs start out already Awakened, and members of the same cabal.) <br>Once the dark secret is revealed to the PCs, the meat-and-potatoes goals (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis,_antithesis,_synthesis">"anti-thesis"</a>) come into play.<br><img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="503" data-original-width="770" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zUK3q3AQl6I/XJZiUKRzgfI/AAAAAAAA1bs/OP2_DUkZcAUr-G8tE8-NMPXHXeYcpfPywCLcBGAs/s640/3305731-ZXHAUJFB-32.jpg" style="clear: both;"><br>Some spoilers for potential dark secrets in the setting: <br><a name="more"></a><ul>
<li>Turns out the leader of the city's foremost cabal has been a <a href="http://forum.theonyxpath.com/forum/main-category/main-forum/the-classic-world-of-darkness/mage-the-ascension/98768-how-to-build-a-golem">golem</a> for quite some time now, controlled by ??? Who knows this other than the PCs? Who stands to benefit? Perhaps everything you knew about the Technocrats vis-a-vis the Traditions in Budapest is a lie? </li>
<li>The Andrássy Rifts have actually been monitored by the Void Engineers from the moment the villa portals were 'abandoned'. Why did they decide to filter out only the nasty Nephandi to protect the city, instead of cleaning up the whole place?</li>
<li>Elections are coming, and there finally seems to be a viable opposition candidate to stand up against the incumbent authoritarian administration. Mages all around town are campaigning for the guy/girl - then, the PCs find out the candidate is a Nephandi ally. What can they do? Will anyone believe them?</li>
<li>The PCs accidentally find out that the hyped and shiny AIs that drive cars, manage traffic, surveillance, and high-end homes are in fact harvested human souls. </li>
</ul>The actual PC goals will depend on the specifics of the dark secret, but generally they will<br><ul>
<li>escape/fight off the faction(s) that know that they know (if any), and want the secret to stay secret;</li>
<li>investigate the mystery/conspiracy behind the dark secret - think <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoylentGreen">"Soylent Green is PEOPLE!"</a> - to understand their own new situation, having found out;</li>
<li>decide whether/how to make the secret public or to take over from the original conspirators and reap the benefits;</li>
<li>implement plan.</li>
</ul>
<img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="1066" data-original-width="1600" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-agBkLYPDvvk/WzJNrsUEENI/AAAAAAAADj4/x-53uKdYwY0x9m5ALDCsxNpOOOVsqfD1ACLcBGAs/s640/STREET%2BIN%2BBUDAPEST%2B24%2BX%2B36.JPG" style="clear: both;"><br><h2>Obstacles</h2>It's the status quo that the characters are up against, all along.<br><ol>
<li>Their mundane goals are hindered by the institutions and social norms that are set against them - <a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/fleshing-out-premise-statement.html">objectified by Paradox</a>, but also the general ambience. Everyone around the city is quick to label people that look or act unusual or weird - 'hipster', 'faggot', 'tree-hugger', 'junky', 'wacko', 'birth tourist', 'imbecile', 'crank', 'freak', 'lunatic fringe', plus all the ethnic, ageist, body-shaming and other slurs are bandied about.<br>The resentment and turned-up noses are just the tip of the iceberg of <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Jim+Crowism">general discrimination</a> - police stop mages more often, they're less likely to find, keep, or earn the same wage for a job. A sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_profiling">racial profiling</a> against non-conformists.</li>
<li>Then, when the dark secret is out, it's once again the status quo that doesn't want them rocking the boat - whoever is implicated in the conspiracy/mystery will do everything in their power to stop the PCs acting on the revelation. </li>

<br>While the setting itself supports Technocracy campaigns, and I will try to make good on that statement in later posts, the premise as it stands is that PCs are at the receiving end of state-sanctioned oppression, and that sort of assumes non-Technocrats.<br>To elaborate further, PCs should ideally be conspicuously, possibly unapologetically "different", marginalized in some way even before they have Awakened.<br>Some examples:<br><a name="more"></a><ul>
<li>a vastly talented but insecure rhythmic gymnast Akashik who has won some championships and is feeling media pressure to ignore the sexual abuse from some coach some years ago, and concentrate on winning gold at the upcoming Olympics</li>
<li>a shaman who used to design buildings with the requirements of ancestral spirits in mind, formerly respected but is reduced to hack jobs to keep his business afloat</li>
<li>a television faith healer with a dwindling sect of followers who meet in secret for fear of getting jailed</li>
<li>a gutter mage who's been camping in the forests around the city since his wife has left him and taken their home along with their children</li>
<li>a Verbena with severe food allergies - non-organic, processed food gives them nasty sores all over</li>
<li>an old-age pensioner watchmaker mage with a tiny little workshop and a burning desire to wind back time</li>
<li>a radio DJ with cerebral palsy who communicates through Classical music</li>
<li>a Sufi mystic refugee granted temporary asylum in exchange for intelligence on a terrorist cell that his brother belongs to</li>
<li>a closet alcoholic chess master/trainer</li>
<li>a taxi driver Hermetic horrified that his past as an informer/thug for the Socialist secret police gets out</li>
<li>a bicycle courier addicted to designer drugs</li>
<li>Society of Ether revolutionary with anger management issues running an underground printing press</li>
<li>hostel manager employed by <span class="tooltip" title="There is a considerable Chinese minority in the city who rely on their extralegal services.">the Tong</span>
</li>
<li>a porn cameraman/gaffer alien worshipper whose magic centers around cheap plastic toys</li>
<li>morbidly obese  AAA game engine programmer working from home, who hardly steps out of his digital bubble, trying desperately to cope with being saddled with a minor nephew ward</li>
<li>secondary school history teacher who has been sacked and shamed over sexual abuse charges when one of his students Awoke</li>
<li>autistic marketeer/fence selling Wonders and magick-infused knick-knacks sourced <a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-andrassy-rifts-magical-premise.html">from the Andrássy Rifts</a>
</li>
</ul>I think Order of Hermes mages would have baggage in this setting, given the still-recent scars left from <a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-technocracy-magical-premise.html">the Socialist rule they'd been associated with</a>.<br>Virtual Adepts in Budapest must be really pissed off about <span class="tooltip" title="I haven't posted about this yet, but they did, big time.">the Technocratic take-over of the Digital Web.</span><br>Dreamspeakers are probably very much like <a href="https://www.newdawnmagazine.com/articles/secrets-of-siberian-shamanism">Siberian shamans</a>, given the folklore.

                    <h2>Central Setting Metaphor</h2>
<a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Paradox_(MTAs)">Paradox</a> that reality-bending will-workers accumulate when their magick goes against consensual reality is a metaphor for discrimination and exclusion - the 'tyranny of the majority' that scorns and derides any occurrence of 'the Other'.<br>Mages, by extension, stand in for all types of 'out-of-the-ordinary', non-mainstream, non-middle-class, non-heterosexual, that a Technocracy-affected society rejects. <br><h2>Premise Statement</h2>An assorted cabal of mages in a contemporary dystopia; an alternate-history Post-Communist Budapest, is trying to get by, combatting intrigue, political repression, and social exclusion, when they discover a dark secret that would change the status quo if revealed, and must decide what to do about it.<br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://budapestbeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/magyarbalint.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="700" height="365" src="https://budapestbeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/magyarbalint.jpg" width="640"></a></div>

<a name="more"></a>Led by an Etherite, a former close associate of the Schiffer cabal's  leader, who has been estranged from his old friend but still maintains  an uneasy alliance with the Schiffer cabal.<br>So much so that the two  collectives actually share their primary headquarters - Villa Schiffer.<br>Given that the Circle Collective's ex-Iteration X-er, currently Etherite leader basically single-handedly invented the Quintessence-machine huffing and puffing in the Villa Schiffer basement, the two cabals are effectively stuck with each other no matter how the two groups' leaders feel.<br>Krausz, the group's head is ex-military, and defected from Iteration-X after a bungled Iraqi mission that got his beloved wife killed - he is adamant that the Convention had a hand in her death, and vowed revenge. He was all but adopted by the Schiffer cabal leader, who had been grooming him as his successor. But then <span class="tootlip" title="A media blunder revealed that there are at least one clone of the Prime Minister. It took massive resources to frame it as an urban myth instead of proven fact.">the Havassy-incident</span> happened, and Krausz felt that his composer mentor's active role in the government cover-up was unconscionable<br>He has been recruiting his former cabal-mates from the Schiffer group with the promise of amassing 'a real Resistance movement', one that won't be afraid to rock the boat.<br>Although he did manage to convince a handful of mages, some in the newly minted collective suspect that 'the Resistance' will not amount to more than sitting around in the cabal's top-secret new chantry on the top floor of the Hotel Budapest, moping about Krausz's ex-wife, and cursing the Schiffer cabal leader.<br>Krausz might not be cut out to be a revolutionary, but his inventions are formidable, and his social network must be vast - he managed to kit out almost half the very top floor of <a href="https://www.danubiushotels.com/en/our-hotels-budapest/hotel-budapest">the Hotel Budapest</a> as a clandestine cabal headquarters with magickal detectors scanning as far as the river Danube. (At a safe distance from his former mentor's hideout.)

<a name="more"></a>A moderate '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik">Realpolitik</a>' faction that is attempting a balancing act, forging compromises with both the Technocratic groups, the anti-magic city administration, and the more radical Traditionalist elements, be they native or visiting.<br>Their chantry is located very close to <a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-andrassy-rifts-magical-premise.html">the Andrássy Rifts</a> at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1gu1mwT2TojgRMIBvrhwy-6zJV4L59s8X&amp;usp=sharing">19 Munkácsy Mihály street</a> - the Schiffer villa that the collective takes its name from, which is <a href="https://varosban.blog.hu/2017/09/13/titkos_budapesti_epuletek_schiffer-villa">a marvellous art deco palace on the inside, and a nondescript little museum building on the outside</a>.<br>The collective centres around a mechanical Node - essentially a big steam-engine style machine that manufactures Quintessence in an easy-to use solid form. The Node Machine is the invention of an Etherite who was until a recent major falling-out, best friends with the collective's Hermetic leader, and whose own cabal nominally still shares the chantry with the Schiffer group. The high-energy blocks are harvested by dedicated Enlightened and mundane engineers with a 24-7 rota, and distributed as a political favour among mages in the city.<br>The collective's apparent success at cautiously assertive diplomacy hinges on their leader, <span class="tooltip" title="Who has, by all official accounts, been dead for the last 50 years!">a prestigious and world-famous Hungarian composer</span>, who enjoys the full support and all the benefits of the worldwide Order of Hermes magical network.<br>They also have a non-Enlightened support network to call on - acolytes and servants who run and maintain the villa and the grounds, as well as civil rights NGOs (with non-Enlightened lawyers and activists who are sympathetic to the mystic cause) that are trying to help mages in the city by lobbying, offering legal counsel, and the like.<br>As might be expected, the collective is widely regarded as wishy-washy sellouts by other Enlightened folk, especially transient 'tourist mages' with no real understanding of local circumstances.

<p>Your mileage may vary - just as with any background music, it might distract instead of enhancing the game, or the individual tracks may not gel together well, especially on shuffle play.</p>

<br>There, I said it.<br>This is arguably the backbone of the setting - it was the first of the defining ideas.<br><br><a name="more"></a>Let me flesh this out.<br><a href="https://welovebudapest.com/en/venue/andrassy-avenue-2/">Andrássy Avenue (Andrássy út)</a> is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and for good reason - it is the lined with grand palazzos on both sides, and a wide, 1.5-mile promenade (longer than <span class="st">the Champs-Élysées!<i>) </i></span>with an antique underground line rumbling just below street level.<br>The villas and palazzos in this alternate reality have all been owned by grand Hermetic masters and their retinue, passed down through generations. No villa of a Hermetic wizard could do without a portal - I think that's understandable.<br>When the Hermetics were ousted from power around 1989, the inhabitants of these grand villas have fled, and the portals fell into disuse. Without maintenance, these portals have started to seep - Umbrood, spirits, talismans and other magic items, and Horizon Realm denizens have been drifting through the Gauntlet into the heart of Budapest.<br><h2>This is either menacing or liberating - whatever your plot/themes require</h2>You (the GM and/or the troupe) can treat this region as a Shallowing or a part of the city where vulgar magic is more likely to be passed off as coincidental.<br>However, my original intention was to<br><ul>
<li>enhance diversity of themes and types of plots -&gt; basically, there is no need to go anywhere else out of Budapest, just have whatever you need come through a portal)</li>
<li>enhance diversity of PCs and NPCs - the Andrássy Rifts attract a vast number of "tourist" mages from all over the world; any and every sort of PC/NPC mage may be justified to be milling around in Budapest, and there is a really big underground market of magical items if you know where to look</li>
<li>offer opportunities for Technocrat-Traditionalist co-operation - to fight off some Nephandic threat that slipped through unheeded</li>
<li>provide a source of wealth for the city (through tourism and the grey magical market) that the powers that be could cite as their political achievement and exploit to stay in power</li>
<li>provide a source of 'terrorist threat' that the powers that be can cite as something they're defending the city from, once again leveraging it to stay in power</li>
</ul>
<h2>Basically, Andrássy Avenue = Bondi Beach</h2>Just replace "laid-back surfer dudes with strange haircuts and jewellery milling about in just shorts and wetsuits" with "exotic and weird wizards of every stripe doing strange stuff".<br>Andrássy Avenue is a magnet for a particular kind of mage - there's Tass everywhere, and the adrenaline rush of uncontrolled Umbrood is just the sort of excitement a 'surfer mage' gets a kick out of.<br>There is probably a cottage industry around mage tourists - buskers, cafés, guided haunted villa tours.<br>This place is basically a licence to go crazy: It could be <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheDreaming">the Dreaming from the original Changeling</a> just as much as <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stalker">the Zone from Stalker</a>.

                    <h2>Disclaimer: This setting does not follow the Mage metaplot, or rather, it presents its own metaplot, if you need one, and choose to use it. Read: No Avatar Storm. </h2>The Technocracy has had a bittersweet run with Budapest - while the organisation has had a lot of success influencing hearts and minds, and shaping the history of the city, events have largely got out of hand.<br>My basic idea was to map<br>on the one hand, the transition from Socialism to democracy in Hungary/Budapest to a parallel power handover within magical secret societies, and<br>on the other, the arguably failed or at least incomplete adoption of a liberal democracy to a chaotic power struggle<br><blockquote class="tr_bq">To my mind, at least, this setup creates a lot of potential for campaigns. If your group likes social manoeuvering, there is intrigue up to your eyeballs, but the tensions and instability between factions can easily spill over into physical conflict if combat is more your thing. </blockquote>
<h2>Budapest Hermetics more or less equal State Socialism </h2>Unbeknownst to ordinary people, the 'soft oppression' associated with the Socialist regime in Hungary was orchestrated and maintained by a coterie of powerful Hermetic mages.<br><blockquote class="tr_bq">If you're interested, <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Socialism">here's a primer on Socialism</a>.</blockquote>Soviet Technocrats, after the failed 1956 revolution, started a human experiment in Budapest - give 'progressive-thinking' Western mages free access into the country, limiting them to the Budapest metropolitan area to contain their shenanigans, and recruit them as allies in <b>the Ascension Cold War<sup>TM</sup></b> <br><br>Some of those visiting were <span class="tooltip" title="A search for a MacGuffin could easily end up stumbling on these skeletons in the closet.">ground up or sold out</span>, but a Hermetic wizard guild soon outmanoeuvered their Soviet Technocrat hosts, and took over governing the city in all but name. They gradually grew ever more oppressive, stymieing growth and human and civil rights alike, and farming out the city to advance their visions of amassing knowledge and discerning the laws of the universe. Their hold over the city and their tyranny unchallenged, they grew just as complacent as the local loyal Communists had before them, until the tides of history inevitably swept them away. Their gradual unshifting <span class="tooltip" title="Campaign idea right there.">that ended in a popular uprising</span> coincided with the overthrow of Communism in the country at large.<br>Not many people are aware, but the 1989 change of government saw 'capitalist' Hermetics ousted from Budapest, and 'socialist' Technocrats sent packing in the rest of the country.<br><blockquote class="tr_bq">Troupes should decide for themselves whether and to what extent they equate <span class="tooltip" title="Detailed write-up of the Budapest School coming up.">the Order of Hermes's Eastern European chapter</span> with the real-life Soviet-influenced ruling elite. While the wizards had surely influenced the architects of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goulash_Communism">'Goulash Communist'</a> system, a one-to-one match would be a slippery slope of blaming history on magic.</blockquote>
<a name="more"></a><h2>The 1989 transition to parliamentary democracy was orchestrated by Western Capitalist Technocrats</h2>The power vacuum saw scores of Technocrats from Western Europe and the US arrive into Hungary, eager to 'format' the 'virgin' Hungarian 'sectors'. However, these new Technocrats were careful - they did not want to end up 'forcing freedom' upon the population, as they thought this would make them just as oppressive as the Hermetic regime they had been told the monster stories about. They were subtle: they figured that an increased average wealth would make people more committed to taking active steps against the regime (I have no idea about economic theory; this is just hand-waved "Primal Utility" magic). It was long known that Danube river water (and mineral waters in Hungary in general) are infused with Prime magic. The Western Technocrats manipulated policy to push through a dam project downstream of Budapest (much like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gab%C4%8D%C3%ADkovo%E2%80%93Nagymaros_Dams">the Gabčíkovo – Nagymaros dams project</a> with the important difference that this one was actually completed). The purported reason was to power some hydroelectric power plant, but the real goal was to slightly increase levels of the river within the city to make everyone richer. They then waited. Their projections were right, and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=15&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwihjNO_0t7gAhUltosKHU22BQ0QFjAOegQIAhAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fscholarworks.iu.edu%2Fjournals%2Findex.php%2Fiusburj%2Farticle%2Fdownload%2F19741%2F25824%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1VPXUQJn9-kku0hcaP8Ux-">the democratic transition</a> happened - made possible by the Technocracy, but carried out by non-magical people.<br><h2>Laissez-faire politics backfire, and the Technocrats who helped oust the Hermetics are themselves thrown out of power</h2>In their efforts to not repeat the mistakes of the Hermetic Budapest overlords, the Technocrats stayed out of day-to-day policymaking. The free-for-all market democracy that followed eroded the country's economic and social resources, and frustrated and embittered many. (I am aware how simplistic and childish this all sounds - this is an alternate history campaign setting for a tabletop roleplaying game, not a political pamphlet.) A neoliberal faction of the local Technocracy calling itself The Co-Operative  ("Szövetkezet") slowly came to overshadow the original Technocratic  administration in the city - it had no scruples about directly  manipulating politics to make sure that their brand of social  engineering stays popular (see <a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/02/non-magical-setting-premise-disclaimer.html">my earlier post about current affairs in the Budapest metro area</a>.)<br><h2>The 2008 financial crisis</h2>The 2008 meltdown hit Budapest hard, and put paid to any hopes for the Technocracy to usher in an era of universal welfare and an egalitarian live-and-let-live society. Budapest became (even more) isolated by its relative wealth. Residents became desperate to hold on to their economic positions. The Co-Operative, basically the local branch of the Syndicate, fueled the bigotry by promoting <a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/02/non-magical-setting-premise-disclaimer.html">the mental self-help practices discussed earlier</a> to solidify its position in power. <br><h2>The Budapest Technocracy now</h2>The Co-Operative is the <i>de facto</i> overseer of all Technocratic activity in the city - up-and-coming bankers, CEOs, industrial lobbyists are calling the shots both for mundane politicians and old guard Technocrats.<br><blockquote class="tr_bq">There are rumours that the Co-Operative is engaged in drug distribution, either directly or through the Chinese Tongs operating in the city. They might also have something to do with a new paramilitary organisation nominally controlled by the Ministry of Interior. Only the GM knows.</blockquote>Traditionally the Progenitors have been the strongest Technocratic faction in Hungary (agricultural yield-enhancing experiments, hybridising crops, innovations in food engineering, etc.).<br><blockquote class="tr_bq">They're still present, but have started focusing on cloning technology - detailed write-up coming soon.</blockquote>The Technocrat HQ is officially still the vast and labyrinthine underground car park below <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/hungary/budapest/attractions/szabadsag-ter/a/poi-sig/1289136/359522">Szabadság tér</a> left intact from Socialist Technocratic rule, but the amalgams operating out of it are increasingly marginalised by the new Co-Op execs, and are seen as "out of touch". Detailed write-up of the location with NPCs and plot hooks coming soon.<br>There might be some cybernetics being developed in Budapest, if the GM's plans need Iteration X to be in the mix - after all, Hungarian video game developers are widely known as cheap and excellent.<br>The Technocracy in Budapest is far from homogeneous - there are groups that blame the 1989 newcomers and their subsequent laissez-faire attitude for all present ills, some who embrace the no-holds-barred market capitalism hyped up by the Co-Op, radicals opposed to both the idealists and the new blood, and of course those that wish the good old Socialist times had never ended.<br><h3>Although the premise is about Traditionalist mages in an unfriendly city, </h3>there is plenty of room for a Technocracy game in the Budapest Urbancrawl setting, and I'll be adding complications and details to this high-level overview as we go along.<br><i></i>

<div>This is an open secret, but people tend to turn a blind eye and keep the current administration (GMs are invited to make use of <a href="https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/hungarian-names.php">the Hungarian name generator</a> to come up with the people ruling the country/city) in power for 3 main reasons, all underpinned by conspicuous propaganda (random news generator coming soon):</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Protection from the threat of terrorism (the threat is (surprisingly!) a real one, but it's actually magical in nature, as we shall see, and politics has no understanding or control over it).<br>This practically means a heightened police presence, people routinely stopped for spot-checks, and some government posters calling for vigilance.</li>
<li>Promises of independence from the rest of the country - Budapest is by far the most affluent part of the country, and the idea that it should stop paying to keep the rest of Hungary above the poverty line is popular(ized). The current ruling party's opposition is horrified by the idea, but the promise of even greater levels of average wealth if and when Budapest becomes an independent city state are alluring to some.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">Note that the city's wealth is also magically induced, and has also nothing to do with which political party happens to be in power.</blockquote>
<ul><li>There's a self-help movement vaguely like Dianetics, emphasizing clarity of thought and efficiency of mental processes that those in power have adopted as the national panacea to cure all societal ills. The official party line, heavily supported by state-sponsored media, is that everyone practising these mental disciplines is psychologically superior to non-practicioners.</li></ul>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">Admittedly, I have yet to come up with any tangible details for this self-help philosophy, apart from its name (the "<b><i>Szekeres-Bara ideals</i></b>"), and that it is opposed to mysticism and the occult.</blockquote>
<h3>Next time: How do the Technocracy, the Traditions, and other magical factions fit into all this?  Where does the so-called terrorism and the very real wealth in Budapest come from?</h3>
