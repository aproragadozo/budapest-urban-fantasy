                    <p>As established, all sorts of Umbral creatures and talismans seep into Budapest across the Andrássy Rifts. It was inevitable that a semi-official market-place should spring up for people looking for magickal knick-knacks. In fact, this market-place was bound to be somewhere on <a href="https://www.budapestbylocals.com/margaret-island.html">Margaret Island</a> (Margit-sziget [<span class="IPA"><span class="IPA">ˈmɒrɡit,</span>siɡɛt</span>]), smack in the middle of the stretch of Danube dividing the city into Buda and Pest, with magickal waters flowing around it.<br><br><img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="600" src="https://www.legifoto.com/files/margitsziget.jpg"><br><br><a name="more"></a>The island itself, on account of the ever-replenishing Quintessence that the Danube around it carries 24-7, is an oasis for not just mages - people are unconsciously drawn to the place and enjoy the natural high that comes with magic literally being in the air.<br>There are joggers, families with children, and anyone aching for the outdoors; there's a swimming pool, a petting zoo, and no internal combustion engines are allowed in.<br></p>
<h2>The market</h2>The 'market' itself is as unassuming as can be - two floating pier sheds full of kayaks, boats, oars, and other boating and kayaking gear on the left-hand side of the photo above (facing the Buda side). They belong to the Budapest Boating Association with a HQ on the opposite side of the island, and only a handful of people know about the sheds' more mystical purpose.<br><img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="600" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EOD25jnvIlw/XK9Dt9lqLmI/AAAAAAAA1iY/TTLUyTEfGSYLkOh3w6WXvM7ZtJx-DPvwgCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20190411_153612_534.jpg"><br><i>View of the kayak and boating paraphernalia sheds that double as the market-place from the Pest quay</i><br>If you know the right passphrase, look familiar to the two 'shopkeepers', or seem like you need an item to help you out (or deserve an item that brings you misery), you will find that the sheds in fact are crammed full of the most interesting magickal stuff, large and small.<br>Customers are normally charged a small quest in exchange for items.<br><h2>Gulyás and Hóbor, the shopkeepers</h2>They're really a two-man Euthanatos cabal who have taken it upon themselves to better the world by controlling the distribution of harmful and beneficial magic items.<br>Gulyás (<span class="IPA">[ˈɡujaːʃ]) is the younger one of the pair, in his twenties, handsome, quiet, brooding, and in fact very manipulative, especially of Hóbor (</span><span class="IPA"><span class="IPA">[ˈhoːbor]</span>), the nominal leader of their little cult. In fact, he's the 'power behind the throne' - Hóbor rarely admits it to himself, but he's head over heels in love with his young ward, and will do anything to keep him by his side. Gulyás is part of the gardening crew on the island, and has a uniform and a pass that gets him access to virtually anywhere on Margit-sziget. The quests he likes to set for people who come looking for talismans and wonders slowly but surely build a web of contacts and information with him sitting in the middle, a fat spider pulling the strings, a but like Leland Gaunt in Needful Things. At least that's the way he likes to think of what he does.</span><br><span class="IPA">Hóbor on the other hand comes as close to a wise old hippy stereotype as a Euthanatos can. likes sharing his unique mystical worldview with anyone who will listen, rambling on while fishing on the pier. He can't hold down a decent job on account of his missing left arm, but the boating association keeps him on as watchmen/groundsman. He keeps bees - all the bees on the island come from one of his hives, tucked in nooks and crannies - and he likes to command them into clouds and direct them around like some Biblical prophet. He can take over the swarm's senses and so finds out about a surprising many things even though he never leaves the island.</span><br><h2><span class="IPA">Sample items</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="IPA">Pair of scissors. When used to cut off all of someone's hair will make collected hair have limited divining powers. Think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SVjE2cg3Tc">Queequeg in the 1956 version</a>.</span></li>
<li><span class="IPA">Some loose leaf tea that when brewed in a special pot with water taken from one of the Buda Hill caverns as part of a secret ritual, will grant the drinker the power to answer any yes-no question correctly within a 24-hour time frame.</span></li>
<li><span class="IPA">A pearl that will make an urn fill up with whatever is already inside when left in it unattended overnight. Causes havoc if urn is opened while magic is going on (along the lines of overabundance (Think jelly flood in Ben and Holly), or a Geas related to the thing that is being multiplied (such as the witness gets allergic to that thing from then on, or must eat/create that thing every day, or cannot say its name).</span></li>
<li><span class="IPA"><a href="https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4334">Betz Sphere</a>: seems to have limited consciousness, moves around on its own accord, self-preserving, attuned to specific frequencies, highly magnetic, resists scrying attempts. Remote-controlled? Mechanical? Organic and alive?</span></li>

                    <p>You enter the Polányi footbridge (pronounced [ˌpɔˈlɑː<span class="IPA">ɲi</span>]) at the Batthyány Square (pronounced <span class="IPA">[ˈbɒcːaːɲi]</span>) quay, walk a 100 metres or so below the Danube river bed, and re-emerge on the Pest side a few hundred meters from Budapest Technocratic Head Offices (<a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-technocracy-magical-premise.html#more">see earlier post</a> for a bit more detail) - that is, when the tunnel isn't undergoing one of those frustrating re-constructions that seem to be happening more and more often.<br>(<i>Disclaimer: I made this up wholesale - don't go looking for the underwater footbridge.</i>)<br><img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="1069" data-original-width="1600" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fKnRyLJa1Vw/XKoHfsLFkQI/AAAAAAAA1iI/9xgGAR3hDYwbwL1mMvzAWeM8EyjRmRPnwCLcBGAs/s320/blur-polanyi.jpg"><br>There's neon-lit garish yellow tilework all through the tunnel, and it has two "lanes" for traffic, one for pedestrians, the other for bicycles, baby carriages, skateboards, et cetera, with a wide divider wall that's interspersed with openings running along the middle.<br>Motorized vehicles understandably banned.<br>Probably lots of service tunnels - emergency exits that lead into safe bunkers that can withstand water pressure and explosions, should there be any accidents. Drone of air circulation fans audible throughout the tunnel, louder in places.<br>Faint aroma of floor polish mixed with the catch of the day - takeaway coffee spilled by low-level ministry officials in a hurry, milk, fish, or vegetables dropping off carriages on their way to the Batthyány Square market hall, some decomposing pigeon pulled apart by crows in the relative safety of the tunnel.<br>Beggars, musician buskers (if there's more than 2, there is no way you can make out any melody as the tunnel acoustics mess up the sound), and usually quite a few security patrols.<br>CCTV.<br></p>
<h2>What you can use it for</h2>The tunnel is great for foot chases - especially when its under construction, and one or both lanes are barricaded off.<br>Given the thick divider walls, there must be quite a few niches where CCTV doesn't pick you up, should a mage require a secluded spot for the exchange of illicit goods and/or information.<br>There's always a chance of an accident, or better yet, a terrorist act that happens to include some of the PCs walking in the tunnel.<br>Hostage situation.<br>A mage terrorist cell (they exist!) attempting to infiltrate the Szabadság tér Szövetkezet (<span class="IPA">[ˈsøvɛtkɛzɛt])</span> headquarters from within the cover of the tunnel.<br>The whole site is kind of spooky, and I imagine both the Gauntlet and the Consensus are a bit flakier than usual down there - just remember that you're 15 metres underground, below a whole lot of water.<br>(Image credit <a href="https://unsplash.com/@dominikmartin">Dominik Martin at Unsplash</a>)

<a name="more"></a>The Monkey King (Majomkirály <span class="IPA">[ˈmɒjom</span><span class="IPA"><span class="IPA">kiraːj</span>] in the original Hungarian)</span>, as he (or she?) calls themselves, is by far the most mysterious magickal inhabitant of the Budapest city state - no-one is really sure of his/her sex or gender. Every mage has heard of him/her, but there have been very few verified sightings. He/she spends most of their time in the Umbra, guarding <a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-rudas-thermal-baths-location-npc.html">the Rudas Bath Horizon node</a>, and, some say, the city as a whole from malevolent incursions. His name is, of course, not far from the lips of the thousands of Chinese descent living in Budapest - he is revered as a patron saint of sorts by the Chinese community, and might be a reason the minority isn't treated too badly by the otherwise quite nationalist council administration or the public.<br>In my game, he is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong">THE Sun Wukong</a>, 'The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal', but I've limited his legendary abilities to the Near Umbra and beyond so as not unbalance the game - my players only met him once, and on Earth he's <i>just</i> an immortal Akashic master:)<br>There is only one other member of his Budapest 'cabal' (he might have several others going on all over the world, who knows) is Hegedűs <span class="IPA">[ˈhɛɡɛdyːʃ]</span>, his real-world representative, an actual academic. She's a materials scientist shaman whose paradigm is that the Umbra isn't 'outer space' but the magnified microcosm of stuff - when she awakens objects' spirits (a popular pastime) and communes across the Gauntlet, she uses microscopes and heavy-duty magnifying glasses, and delves into the gap between the barbs of feathers.<br><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-right: 1em; text-align: left; width: 100%;"><tbody>

<br>In the M:TBU setting, it is a location much like <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Digital_Web_(book)">the Spy's Demise BBS detailed in Digital Web</a>: perhaps the only place in town where the Awakened and Enlightened of any stripe can come together and talk without fear of aggression. By mutual agreement, Technocrats and Traditionalist, hell, even upstart Disparates, can rub shoulders here and chat.<br>How is that possible?<br><a name="more"></a><h1>Location</h1> The waters of  the Rudas Thermal Bath are heavily <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_(MTAs)">Prime-infused</a> and serves as the basis of an implicit truce - no need to fight when there's plenty of the good stuff for everyone.<br><h4>The Baths are ideal for making plans, diplomatic encounters, trying to ferret out the enemies plans, subtle backstabbing, building up or losing face, or just to lay back &amp; soak up Quintessence in wondrous environment.</h4>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>I like to play up the intoxicating nature of this  naturally-occurring Quintessence so that getting wet is like having a  few beers. You get giddy if you save your saving throw.</h4>(Mechanically, I give everyone who stays at least an hour in the water d10/2 temporary Quintessence - they only find out how much when they leave, and it's lost if not used up within 24 hours. That's not a tamper proof rule, but what is?)<br>The explanation is that there's a Horizon node with a portal somewhere inside <a href="https://welovebudapest.com/en/venue/gellert-hill-2/">Gellért Hill</a>, where the magickal water springs from. Its location is a secret guarded from everyone, including their Traditionalist peers, by <span class="tooltip" title="To be covered in a future post.">the Monkey King Collective,</span> a small cabal of semi-rogue Budapest mages.<br><h4>If the spring fell into the wrong hands, the fallout would be devastating.</h4>Though the Technocracy pays lip-service to the agreement that everyone has equal rights to the magick water, they still keep trying to covertly find the Rudas Node - and some would say every single other faction is after the Node too. <a href="https://www.xpatloop.com/channels/2018/09/gellert-hill-funicular-under-construction.html">There is a funicular secretly being built that would carve into the side of the hill</a> - it's an open secret that this is a smokescreen to cover the search for the Node, but no-one is sure who is behind the project.<br><h1>NPC</h1>Everyone who's been to the place more than twice knows Béla (<span class="st">[ˈbeːlɒ]) (and he will definitely know regulars by name), the affable if moody locker room attendant who some think might be <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Extraordinary_Citizen">an Extraordinary Citizen</a> or <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product_info.php?products_id=19&amp;it=1&amp;language=es&amp;">a consor</a>. The amount of magickal activity he must have been exposed to in his decades on the job could have affected him, but others think he's actually 'repelling magick and/or Paradox', arguing that he couldn't have survived. Anyways, he's a talking point among bath patrons - an ice-breaker when at a loss for what to say.</span><br><span class="st">He's got a no-nonsense attitude and never gets fazed by anything - he sure acts like he's seen it all.</span><br><table class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</table>He could be a fixer, a concierge, a messenger, a procurer of under-the-counter goods and/or a fountainhead of gossip for your PCs.<br>In my game he's a decidedly non-magickal ex-con who's got the cushy job in exchange for regular reports to <a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-technocracy-magical-premise.html">the people in the Szabadság Square bunkers</a>. His job description includes turning a blind eye to the shenanigans of mages high on Quintessence, and taking notes, but he likes bribes, and anyone who helps his daughter (a stunning and bubbly ballerina who tends to get mixed up in trouble) has a place in his heart.<br><h1>Plot Hook</h1>These are variations on "protect the water", but there's always the Nephandus plot that subtly taints the water to cause strife and overdoses.<br><ul>
<li>Magick is no protection against encroaching bureaucracy - council plans to shut down the place temporarily or to modify its water source (!) must be stopped by hook or by crook. Legal, illegal, or magickal.</li>
<li>The bath-house is being renovated, and builders find a Wonder or a portal (could it be the sought-after link to the Node?). Technocrats and Mages need to band together to overcome the inevitable pointing of fingers and point-scoring to hush up the discovery.</li>
<li>The water starts to ebb. What's up? Foul play in Budapest, or some trouble over at the Horizon end?</li>
