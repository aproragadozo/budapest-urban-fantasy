<html><body><p>This is part one in a series of high-level overviews of the 4 main Traditionalist factions in my Mage: The Budapest Urbancrawl campaign.<br></p><h2><span style="color: red;">Spoiler alert</span></h2>For those not playing with a collaborative world-building kind of troupe style, there might be some traditionally GM-only background material in this post.<br><h2>Schiffer cabal</h2><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-right: 1em; text-align: left; width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://6.kerulet.ittlakunk.hu/files/ittlakunk/styles/large/public/upload/event/6469/schiffer1.jpg?itok=fyhwvGWL&amp;slideshow=true&amp;slideshowAuto=true&amp;slideshowSpeed=4000&amp;speed=350&amp;transition=none" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="544" data-original-width="800" height="433" src="https://6.kerulet.ittlakunk.hu/files/ittlakunk/styles/large/public/upload/event/6469/schiffer1.jpg?itok=fyhwvGWL&amp;slideshow=true&amp;slideshowAuto=true&amp;slideshowSpeed=4000&amp;speed=350&amp;transition=none" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The Schiffer villa, the cabal's headquarters</td></tr></tbody></table><a name="more"></a>A moderate '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik">Realpolitik</a>' faction that is attempting a balancing act, forging compromises with both the Technocratic groups, the anti-magic city administration, and the more radical Traditionalist elements, be they native or visiting.<br>Their chantry is located very close to <a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-andrassy-rifts-magical-premise.html">the Andrássy Rifts</a> at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1gu1mwT2TojgRMIBvrhwy-6zJV4L59s8X&amp;usp=sharing">19 Munkácsy Mihály street</a> - the Schiffer villa that the collective takes its name from, which is <a href="https://varosban.blog.hu/2017/09/13/titkos_budapesti_epuletek_schiffer-villa">a marvellous art deco palace on the inside, and a nondescript little museum building on the outside</a>.<br>The collective centres around a mechanical Node - essentially a big steam-engine style machine that manufactures Quintessence in an easy-to use solid form. The Node Machine is the invention of an Etherite who was until a recent major falling-out, best friends with the collective's Hermetic leader, and whose own cabal nominally still shares the chantry with the Schiffer group. The high-energy blocks are harvested by dedicated Enlightened and mundane engineers with a 24-7 rota, and distributed as a political favour among mages in the city.<br>The collective's apparent success at cautiously assertive diplomacy hinges on their leader, <span class="tooltip" title="Who has, by all official accounts, been dead for the last 50 years!">a prestigious and world-famous Hungarian composer</span>, who enjoys the full support and all the benefits of the worldwide Order of Hermes magical network.<br>They also have a non-Enlightened support network to call on - acolytes and servants who run and maintain the villa and the grounds, as well as civil rights NGOs (with non-Enlightened lawyers and activists who are sympathetic to the mystic cause) that are trying to help mages in the city by lobbying, offering legal counsel, and the like.<br>As might be expected, the collective is widely regarded as wishy-washy sellouts by other Enlightened folk, especially transient 'tourist mages' with no real understanding of local circumstances.</body></html>
