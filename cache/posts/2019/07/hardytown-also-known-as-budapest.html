He is the main employer for people living in the district, directly or indirectly, through shell companies. Very many people's livelihood depends on not getting on his wrong side. To be fair, there are countless projects he's introduced, organizing street fairs, promoting businesses (the 'right' ones), offering aid to old age pensioners and youth, building and maintaining playgrounds, all the sorts of things people expect from a mayor. He's popular, then; people grumble, but vote for him time and again.<br>GMs might equally make him out to be either a sinister figure (that is, a Szövetkezet technocrat or someone influenced by a Syndicate advisor), or a well-meaning man-of-the-people corrupted and turned into little more than a mobster by power.<br><h2>Plot hook</h2><ul><li>Nasty-looking, extremely ripe mangoes turn up at fire-sale prices in recently opened outlet of supermarket chain that was hyped in all the local media.
