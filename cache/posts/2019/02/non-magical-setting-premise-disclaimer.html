The current ruling party's opposition is horrified by the idea, but the promise of even greater levels of average wealth if and when Budapest becomes an independent city state are alluring to some.</li></ul><blockquote class="tr_bq">Note that the city's wealth is also magically induced, and has also nothing to do with which political party happens to be in power.</blockquote><ul><li>There's a self-help movement vaguely like Dianetics, emphasizing clarity of thought and efficiency of mental processes that those in power have adopted as the national panacea to cure all societal ills. The official party line, heavily supported by state-sponsored media, is that everyone practising these mental disciplines is psychologically superior to non-practicioners.</li></ul><blockquote class="tr_bq">Admittedly, I have yet to come up with any tangible details for this self-help philosophy, apart from its name (the "<b><i>Szekeres-Bara ideals</i></b>"), and that it is opposed to mysticism and the occult.</blockquote><h3>Next time: How do the Technocracy, the Traditions, and other magical factions fit into all this?Â  Where does the so-called terrorism and the very real wealth in Budapest come from?</h3><h4></h4></div></body></html>
