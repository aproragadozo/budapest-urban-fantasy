<html><body><p>The spirit of the tallest tower block has awakened in Budapest's District 15 (Újpalota <span class="IPA">[</span><span class="IPA"><span class="IPA">ˈuːj</span>ˈpɒlotɒ], </span>although many local Szekeres-Bara practitioners now routinely call it <i>Clear City</i>. very Budapest district has been semi-officially been re-christened to reflect some benefit or tenet of the Szekeres-Bara movement; the pattern is '<i>&lt;unique-name&gt; City|Town</i>'), which is mostly one big prefab housing project with patches of greenery.<br><img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="449" height="320" src="https://m.blog.hu/ha/hazakbanjartunk/image/wp_20150207_15_44_34_pro.jpg"><br><br><a name="more"></a>It was originally built as a water tower to boost water pressure in the housing estate that mushroomed around it a few decades ago (hence the name <i>Water Tower High-Rise</i>) - have a look at <a href="https://hazakbanjartunk.blog.hu/2015/02/19/ujpalotai_viztoronyhaz">lots of photos, floor plan, and section plans</a>.<br><br><img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="616" data-original-width="1376" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BJcWEpfpBuA/XO_ownHDzRI/AAAAAAAA1tI/pewVO1rLF7wdYaV6XOo3iJFMukA8bW6LACLcBGAs/s320/Ujpalota.png"><br>Then, the fateful decision was made to pull up a residential high-rise around the tower with the huge tank at the top.<br>Perhaps it was the unfamiliar presence of all those bodies and minds around it; first the builders, then the families moving in? Perhaps it was the building technology, quite unique in the district (the building is actually not a prefab at all)? Perhaps it was that the high-rise was meant to be the iconic symbol of the district, and the intention was a success beyond the city planners' wildest dreams? However it happened, the building's spirit woke up.<br></p><h2>Personality </h2>It has, from Day 1, considered itself a sort of guardian or mother figure<br><ul><li>to its 'little siblings', that is, the bunches of 10-story prefabs that stream out from its hub like the spokes of a wheel,</li><li>to the tiny little people with the exotic little consciousness-blobs hanging around them,</li><li>to the trees, playgrounds, statues</li></ul>After all, it had been its duty to supply nurturing, cleaning, refreshing, sustaining drinking water to most of them. (The building was a functioning water tower for only ten years after being erected.)<br>In exchange for favours, the tower spirit always asks for some quest to be undertaken to help the district in a specific or general way - clean up park, replace lock, make crossing in front of kindergarten safe, find key/pet parrot/lost cat and return it to owner, prevent suicide, prevent local branch of library from getting cut from next year's budget, etc.<br>However, to this day the water pipes act as a surveillance network of sorts through which the Water Tower High-Rise has psychic access to a surprisingly large proportion of the district's built environment - the specifics of this link is left to Storyteller discretion.<br>What is certain, however, is that to make use of the effect, a mage needs to enter the former cisterns at the very top of the tower, either physically, or in the Penumbra.<br><h2>Gate-keeper</h2>The erstwhile cisterns have been remodelled into two large studio flats, inside one of which lives, rent-free, Harsányi (<span class="IPA">ˈhɒrʃaːɲ</span><span class="IPA"><span class="IPA">i</span>]), the council-sponsored caretaker of the high-rise. He's joint building manager, condominium representative, janitor, and snitch for the Szövetkezet (the local Syndicate-flavour Technocratic upstarts), all rolled into one.</span><br><span class="IPA">He's a spineless and petty yes-man, but also a practising chess champion - he can get really passionate and nerdy about his hobby, which the only aspect of his life not dominated by council rules and regulations.</span><br><span class="IPA"><span class="IPA">Should PC wizards want to get inside the ex-tanks (to commit some <strike>terrorist</strike> counter-revolutionary attack, or ask the tower spirit some questions about the district goings-on, perhaps), they will find that Harsányi's chess obsession has created a bubble of local consensus aggressively hostile towards those of the willworker persuasion.</span></span></body></html>
