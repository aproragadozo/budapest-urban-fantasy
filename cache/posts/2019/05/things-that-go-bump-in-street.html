Traffic diverted. Various types of overloud music blasting and/or live band(s) playing on a dais, children laughing/crying/shouting, smell of cotton candy and sweat, flags, costumes, confetti.</td>  </tr><tr>    <td rowspan="2">3</td>    <td><img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="1067" data-original-width="1600" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U32O23YjZ-A/XM8owS65YII/AAAAAAAA1mc/gaVy602t7gwg15FHwMm0d_3G1OcGzb8ZQCLcBGAs/s320/florian-weichelt-1496849-unsplash.jpg"></td>  </tr><tr>    <td style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;">Street fair, improvised street market, Christmas/Halloween/Easter/Mother's Day/Valentine's Day/etc. Market.

Traffic and public transport lines diverted for weeks/months, sound of heavy machinery drowning out everything, ridiculous traffic jams, hasty and confusing temporary road signage, lots of hard hat wearing construction workers loafing about, perhaps traffic police controlling traffic. Hoardings promising a lovely new road/square/underground railway line/park/etc. once the construction is over, asking for people's patience.</td>  </tr><tr>    <td rowspan="2">5</td>    <td><img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="534" data-original-width="800" src="https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/diplomatic-vehicles-are-parked-in-front-of-the-entrance-of-the-saudi-picture-id1051959176"></td>  </tr><tr>    <td style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;">Convoy/platoon of diplomatic vehicles so long that it chokes traffic on bridge/avenue. Black-tinted windows and windshields, perhaps even flashing lights, but definitely standstill. Air of mystery about who all these high-ranking people are and what they are/have been doing here.</td>  </tr><tr>    <td rowspan="2">6</td>    <td><img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="506" data-original-width="760" src="https://kep.cdn.index.hu/1/0/811/8110/81104/8110416_1e87051f50a45665fb4ce946759a3563_wm.jpg"></td>  </tr><tr>    <td style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;">Accident.

Stopping passers-by, drivers, and people riding the bus or tram. Looking for drugs/weapons/unauthorized immigrants/fugitives, whatnot. More often than not actually screening magick-users and magickal artifatcs with a handheld scanner that goes beep when it detects Quintessence, Mind magick, or whatever else it has been calibrated to spot. Mages with suspect objects are probably taken in for questioning, possibly let off with a warning, but will definitely draw the unwanted and hostile attention of the crowd.</td>  </tr><tr>    <td rowspan="2">8</td>    <td><img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="1063" data-original-width="1600" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2_mhiPd5kQA/XM806p3VBsI/AAAAAAAA1mo/CuK7VGgIIpYbzQTLppQpfM9C7eMMAqLGwCLcBGAs/s320/sport.jpg"></td>  </tr><tr>    <td style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;">Mass sporting event.

Most likely either a product sample handout/subscription drive, or a free on-the-spot mental hygiene checkup provided by <span class="tooltip" title="The hybrid of the Silva Mind Control and Dianetics that is the state-sponsored quasi-religion in Budapest.">a trained Szekeres-Bara method professional</span>.
