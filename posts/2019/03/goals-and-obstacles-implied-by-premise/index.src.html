<html><body><p>Thinking further about what <a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/fleshing-out-premise-statement.html">the Premise Statement</a> implies, still following <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/184668/Setting-Design-Black-Box-Edition">the Setting Design book</a>, I'd like to detail the potential goals of <a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/characters-implied-by-premise-statement.html">the characters that fit the premise</a>, and the obstacles that make their lives interesting.<br></p><h2>Goals</h2>The initial goals, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis,_antithesis,_synthesis">the "thesis" of the campaign</a>, if you will, will be quite mundane - make ends meet, be able to practice your magick in peace/unharassed,  not go to jail, help friends not go to jail, try to get rich off some magickal artifact looted (at great personal danger) from a villa in the Andrássy Rifts, pay through the nose for such an artifact, be hired by one of the Chinese Tongs for an odd job, etc. Routine stuff to familiarize the players and the GM with the setting.<br>(I'm assuming the PCs start out already Awakened, and members of the same cabal.) <br>Once the dark secret is revealed to the PCs, the meat-and-potatoes goals (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis,_antithesis,_synthesis">"anti-thesis"</a>) come into play.<br><img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="503" data-original-width="770" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zUK3q3AQl6I/XJZiUKRzgfI/AAAAAAAA1bs/OP2_DUkZcAUr-G8tE8-NMPXHXeYcpfPywCLcBGAs/s640/3305731-ZXHAUJFB-32.jpg" style="clear: both;"><br>Some spoilers for potential dark secrets in the setting: <br><a name="more"></a><ul><li>Turns out the leader of the city's foremost cabal has been a <a href="http://forum.theonyxpath.com/forum/main-category/main-forum/the-classic-world-of-darkness/mage-the-ascension/98768-how-to-build-a-golem">golem</a> for quite some time now, controlled by ??? Who knows this other than the PCs? Who stands to benefit? Perhaps everything you knew about the Technocrats vis-a-vis the Traditions in Budapest is a lie? </li><li>The Andrássy Rifts have actually been monitored by the Void Engineers from the moment the villa portals were 'abandoned'. Why did they decide to filter out only the nasty Nephandi to protect the city, instead of cleaning up the whole place?</li><li>Elections are coming, and there finally seems to be a viable opposition candidate to stand up against the incumbent authoritarian administration. Mages all around town are campaigning for the guy/girl - then, the PCs find out the candidate is a Nephandi ally. What can they do? Will anyone believe them?</li><li>The PCs accidentally find out that the hyped and shiny AIs that drive cars, manage traffic, surveillance, and high-end homes are in fact harvested human souls. </li></ul>The actual PC goals will depend on the specifics of the dark secret, but generally they will<br><ul><li>escape/fight off the faction(s) that know that they know (if any), and want the secret to stay secret;</li><li>investigate the mystery/conspiracy behind the dark secret - think <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoylentGreen">"Soylent Green is PEOPLE!"</a> - to understand their own new situation, having found out;</li><li>decide whether/how to make the secret public or to take over from the original conspirators and reap the benefits;</li><li>implement plan.</li></ul><img border="0" class="fitt" data-original-height="1066" data-original-width="1600" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-agBkLYPDvvk/WzJNrsUEENI/AAAAAAAADj4/x-53uKdYwY0x9m5ALDCsxNpOOOVsqfD1ACLcBGAs/s640/STREET%2BIN%2BBUDAPEST%2B24%2BX%2B36.JPG" style="clear: both;"><br><h2>Obstacles</h2>It's the status quo that the characters are up against, all along.<br><ol><li>Their mundane goals are hindered by the institutions and social norms that are set against them - <a href="https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/2019/03/fleshing-out-premise-statement.html">objectified by Paradox</a>, but also the general ambience. Everyone around the city is quick to label people that look or act unusual or weird - 'hipster', 'faggot', 'tree-hugger', 'junky', 'wacko', 'birth tourist', 'imbecile', 'crank', 'freak', 'lunatic fringe', plus all the ethnic, ageist, body-shaming and other slurs are bandied about.<br>The resentment and turned-up noses are just the tip of the iceberg of <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Jim+Crowism">general discrimination</a> - police stop mages more often, they're less likely to find, keep, or earn the same wage for a job. A sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_profiling">racial profiling</a> against non-conformists.</li><li>Then, when the dark secret is out, it's once again the status quo that doesn't want them rocking the boat - whoever is implicated in the conspiracy/mystery will do everything in their power to stop the PCs acting on the revelation. </li></ol></body></html>
